This review comprehensively compiles existing knowledge regarding the biogenesis, function, and clinical relevance of circRNAs, emphasizing their stability, abundance, and cell type-specific expression profiles, which make them ideal candidates for noninvasive early biomarkers in cancer treatment. We explored the roles of circRNAs in oncogenesis and tumor progression and their complex interactions with patient responses to various cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Through the analysis of data from recent studies and clinical trials, we underscore the prognostic significance of serum circRNAs in predicting therapeutic outcomes, their involvement in resistance mechanisms, and their capacity to inform personalized treatment approaches. Additionally, this review addresses the obstacles inherent in circRNA research, including the need for standardized protocols for circRNA extraction and quantification and the elucidation of the clinical significance of circRNAs. Furthermore, our investigation extends to future prospects, including embedding circRNA profiling into regular clinical workflows and pioneering circRNA-based therapeutic approaches.

Over the last few decades, treatment of severe AS has been revolutionised following the development of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Despite improvements in outcomes, older adults with competing comorbidities and geriatric syndromes have suboptimal quality of life outcomes, highlighting the cumulative vulnerability that persists despite valve replacement. Sarcopenia, characterised by loss of muscle strength, mass and function, affects 21%-70% of older adults with AS. Sarcopenia is an independent predictor of short-term and long-term outcomes after TAVR and should be incorporated as a prognostic marker in preprocedural planning. Early diagnosis and treatment of sarcopenia may reduce morbidity and mortality and improve quality of life following TAVR. The adverse effects of sarcopenia can be mitigated through resistance training and optimisation of nutritional status. This is most efficacious when administered before sarcopenia has progressed to advanced stages. Management should be individualised based on the patient's wishes/preferences, care goals and physical capability. Exercise during the preoperative waiting period may be safe and effective in most patients with severe AS.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of six duodenoscope sampling and culturing methods by means of extraction efficacy comparison, while at the same time identifying key parameters that provide optimal microbial recovery. The duodenoscope sample extraction efficacy of each method was assessed using the repetitive recovery method described in ISO 11737-1: 2018. The results obtained indicated that the mean overall bioburden extraction efficacy varied from 1% for the Australian method to 39% for the French one. The lowest endoscope sample extraction efficacy was associated with the absence of any neutralizer, friction, or tensioactive agent and when only a small portion of the sampling solution collected was inoculated onto culture media. The efficacy of the sampling and culturing methods also varied according to the nature of microorganisms present in the endoscope, and the time between sampling and culturing.

Donor lungs have proved to be surprisingly robust, and therefore the donor pool is actually larger than previously thought. Parallel to this, lung transplant outcomes have continued to improve with improved acute management as well as microbiological and immunological insights and innovations. The management of lung transplant recipients continues to be complex and heavily dependent on a tertiary care multidisciplinary paradigm. Whilst long term outcomes continue to be limited by chronic lung allograft dysfunction improvements in diagnostics, mechanistic understanding and evolutions in treatment paradigms have all contributed to a median survival that in some centres approaches 10\u2009years.

Traditional tissue engineering has faced challenges due to irregular cell distribution on scaffolds, limited cell density, and the difficulty of manufacturing patient-specific tissues, which 3D bioprinting overcomes through layer-by-layer fabrication. This has immense significance for addressing organ shortages and enhancing transplant options for the future. 3D printing fully functional organs is a far-sighted dream; however, the field is moving in the right direction, and research is being done to shorten the gap between the dream and reality. Notably, bioprinting's precision and compatibility with complex geometries have fueled its demand for lab-grown tissue constructs. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), a cornerstone of engineering, finds relevance in diverse sectors, including bioengineering. Its cost-effectiveness and accurate simulation capabilities have drawn attention to its application in bioprinting research. CFD plays a pivotal role in optimizing 3D bioprinting by testing parameters like shear stress, diffusivity, and cell viability. This reduces the need for repetitive experiments, curbing costs and time. CFD simulations also enable the analysis of flow behaviors and material deformation under stress, aiding in material selection and bioprinter nozzle design. This review delves into recent applications of CFD in 3D bioprinting, shedding light on its potential to enhance the performance of this technology. Through this integration, CFD offers a pathway to advancing bioprinting, thus contributing to the evolution of regenerative medicine and healthcare. This article is protected by copyright.

Studies in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> have identified evolutionarily conserved molecular pathways that enable axonal degeneration and regeneration of damaged axons and/or dendrites. This protocol describes a simple method for inducing nerve crush injury to motoneuron and sensory neuron axons in the peripheral (segmental) nerves in second- or early third-instar larvae. Small forceps are used to pinch the cuticle at a location that overlays the segmental nerves. Although the connective tissue of the nerves remains intact and the larva survives the injury, single motoneuron and sensory neuron axons incur a break in continuity at the damage site and then undergo Wallerian degeneration distal to the break. This degeneration includes the dismantling of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapses formed by the axons that incurred damage. With stereotyped anatomy and accessibility to structural and electrophysiological studies, the larval NMJ is a good model to characterize the cellular changes that occur in synapses undergoing degeneration and to identify conditions that can protect axons and synapses from degeneration.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "04", "day": "22"}}, {"article_title": "Understanding health equity in patient-reported outcomes.", "article_abstract": "Patient reported outcomes (PROs) are measures of patients' health that are conveyed directly by individual patients.

However, the coupled relationship between nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) and algal blooms and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To address this issue, <sup>15</sup>N isotope cultures and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiments were conducted in Zhanjiang Bay during algal and non-algal bloom periods. The results showed that denitrification and nitrification-denitrification were the two processes responsible for the in-situ production of N<sub>2</sub>O during algal and non-algal bloom periods. Stable isotope rate cultivation experiments indicated that denitrification and nitrification-denitrification were promoted in the water during the algal bloom period. The in-situ production of N<sub>2</sub>O during the algal bloom period was three-fold that during the non-algal bloom period. This may be because fresh particulate organic matter (POM) from the organisms responsible for the algal bloom provides the necessary anaerobic and hypoxic environment for denitrification and nitrification-denitrification in the degradation environment. Additionally, a positive linear correlation between N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and denitrifying bacteria (nirK and nirS) also supported the significant denitrification and nitrification-denitrification occurring in the water during the algal bloom period.

Indeed, we observe that both gyration radius and knot length vary nonmonotonically with \u03c3<sub>CI</sub>, with both small and bulky CIs favoring knot localization, while medium-sized ones promote delocalized knots.

The emerging conformers correspond to the minima of the free energy landscape profiled as a function of the knot length or PE size. We demonstrate that different conformational states can coexist, the transition between them appearing first-order-like and controlled by the enthalpic and entropic trade-off of the amount of CIs condensed on the PE. Such balance can be further altered by varying CI concentrations, thus providing an additional and more convenient tuning parameter for the system properties.

This enhanced precision not only fosters improved crop yields but also mitigates issues of over-fertilization, aligning with the principles of sustainable agriculture. Furthermore, nanohybrid fertilizers exhibit the promise of minimizing environmental impact. Their controlled release mechanisms significantly reduce nutrient runoff, thereby curbing water pollution and safeguarding ecosystems. This dual benefit of precision nutrient delivery and environmental sustainability positions nanohybrid fertilizers as a crucial tool in the arsenal of precision agriculture practices. The intricate processes of uptake, translocation, and biodistribution of nutrients within plants are examined in the context of nanohybrid fertilizers. The nanoscale features of these formulations play a pivotal role in governing the efficiency of nutrient absorption, internal transport, and distribution within plant tissues. Factors affecting the performance of nanohybrid fertilizers are scrutinized, encompassing aspects such as soil type, crop variety, and environmental conditions. Understanding these variables is crucial for tailoring nanohybrid formulations to specific agricultural contexts, and optimizing their impact on crop productivity and resource efficiency.

Disruption of innate immune cell function can explain the observed susceptibility of CN-NFAT inhibitors-treated patients to opportunistic fungal infections. Neutrophils play an essential role in innate immunity as a defense against pathogens, however, the effect of CN-NFAT inhibitors on neutrophil function was poorly described. Thus, we tested the response of human neutrophils to opportunistic fungal pathogens, namely Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus in the presence of CN-NFAT inhibitors. Here, we report that the NFAT pathway members were expressed in neutrophils and mediated part of the neutrophil response to pathogens. Upon pathogen exposure, neutrophils underwent profound transcriptomic changes with subsequent production of effector molecules. Importantly, genes and proteins involved in the regulation of the immune response and chemotaxis, including the chemokines CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4 were significantly upregulated. The presence of CN-NFAT inhibitors attenuated the expression of these chemokines and impaired the ability of neutrophils to chemoattract other immune cells.

Here, we report that procoagulant platelets bear large amounts of such immunomodulatory factors and that the presence of these cellular blood components in TNBC relates to pro-tumorigenic immune cell activity and impaired survival. Mechanistically, tumor-released nucleic acids attract platelets into the aberrant tumor microvasculature where they undergo procoagulant activation, thus delivering specific stimulatory and inhibitory IC molecules. This concomitantly promotes pro-tumorigenic myeloid leukocyte responses and compromises anti-tumorigenic lymphocyte activity, ultimately supporting tumor growth. Interference with platelet-leukocyte interactions prevented immune cell misguidance and suppressed tumor progression, nearly as effective as systemic IC inhibition. Hence, our data uncover a self-sustaining mechanism of TNBC in utilizing platelets to misdirect immune cell responses.

This study investigates these effects using a chronic sleep deprivation (CSD) model in mice. Our investigation reveals that CSD significantly alters the retinal circadian transcriptome, leading to remarkable changes in the temporal patterns of enriched pathways. This perturbation extends to metabolic and immune-related transcriptomes, coupled with an accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the retina. Notably, CSD rhythmically affects the thickness of the ganglion cell complex, along with diurnal shifts in microglial migration and morphology within the retina. Most critically, we observe a marked decrease in both scotopic and photopic retinal function under CSD conditions.

Simple assays that introduce injuries to axons in either adult flies or larvae have proven to be particularly powerful for uncovering mechanisms of axonal degeneration and clearance.

Because axons and dendrites in the larval peripheral nervous system can be readily visualized through the translucent cuticle, another versatile method to probe injury responses is to focus high-energy laser light to a small and specific location in the animal. We therefore discuss a method for immobilizing intact larvae for imaging through the cuticle to carry out injury by pulse dye laser, which can be used to generate many different kinds of injuries and directed ablations within intact larvae.

This is particularly concerning in pediatric patients. While arachnoid cysts are asymptomatic in most cases, they can cause clinical symptoms in a minority of cases, especially when they occur in unusual sites.

These preclude evaluation of finite-temperature free-energy corrections, limiting thermochemical calculations to enthalpies only. Full-dimensional vibrational frequency calculations are possible by replacing the fixed-atom constraints with harmonic confining potentials.

In the US, \u223c65% of reproductive aged women are estimated to be using contraceptive options, with \u223c33% using one or a combination of hormonal contraceptives. While these methods have undeniably contributed to improved reproductive health, recent studies have raised concerns regarding their potential impact on metabolic health. Despite widespread anecdotal reports, epidemiological research has been mixed as to whether hormonal contraceptives contribute to metabolic health effects. As such, the goals of this study were to assess the adipogenic activity of common hormonal contraceptive chemicals and their mixtures. Five different models of adipogenesis were utilized to provide a rigorous assessment of metabolism disrupting effects. Interestingly, every individual contraceptive (both estrogens and progestins) and each mixture promoted significant adipogenesis (e.g., triglyceride accumulation and/or pre-adipocyte proliferation). These effects appeared to be mediated in part through estrogen receptor signaling, particularly for the contraceptive mixtures, as co-treatment with fulvestrant acted to inhibit contraceptive-mediated pro-adipogenic effects on triglyceride accumulation. In conclusion, this research provides valuable insights into the complex interactions between hormonal contraceptives and adipocyte development. The results suggest that both progestins and estrogens within these contraceptives can influence adipogenesis, and the specific effects may vary based on the receptor activation profiles.

Hence, quantitative proteomics of CH12<i>tfg</i>KO and WT B cells in combination with lysosomal inhibition should identify proteins that are prone to lysosomal degradation and contribute to autophagy and B cell survival. Lysosome inhibition via NH<sub>4</sub>Cl unexpectedly reduced a number of proteins but increased a large cluster of translational, ribosomal, and mitochondrial proteins, independent of TFG. Hence, we propose a role for lysosomes in ribophagy in B cells. TFG-regulated proteins include CD74, BCL10, or the immunoglobulin JCHAIN. Gene ontology (GO) analysis reveals that proteins regulated by TFG alone, or in concert with lysosomes, localize to mitochondria and membrane-bound organelles. Likewise, TFG regulates the abundance of metabolic enzymes, such as ALDOC and the fatty acid-activating enzyme ACOT9. To test consequently for a function of TFG in lipid metabolism, we performed shotgun lipidomics of glycerophospholipids. Total phosphatidylglycerol is more abundant in CH12<i>tfg</i>KO B cells. Several glycerophospholipid species with similar acyl side chains, such as 36:2 phosphatidylethanolamine and 36:2 phosphatidylinositol, show a dysequilibrium.

Among various proteins, Cadherin-11 (CDH11) has been reported to be overexpressed on myofibroblasts in fibrotic tissues. Anti-apoptotic proteins such as (B cell lymphoma-2) (BCL-2) are also upregulated on myofibroblasts. Therefore, we hypothesize that CDH11 could be a targeted domain for cell-specific drug delivery and targeted inhibition of BCL-2 to ameliorate the development of fibrosis in the skin. To prove our hypothesis, we have developed liposomes (LPS) conjugated with CDH11 neutralizing antibody (antiCDH11) to target cell surface CDH11 and loaded these LPS with a BCL-2 inhibitor, Navitoclax (NAVI), to induce apoptosis of CDH11 expressing fibroblasts. The developed LPS were evaluated for physicochemical characterization, stability, in vitro therapeutic efficacy using dermal fibroblasts, and in vivo therapeutic efficacy in bleomycin-induced skin fibrosis model in mice. The findings from in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed that selectivity of LPS was improved towards CDH11 expressing myofibroblasts, thereby improving therapeutic efficacy with no indication of adverse effects.

Infecting humans with controlled doses of helminths, such as human hookworm (termed hookworm therapy), is proposed as a treatment for many of the same diseases. Helminths induce immunoregulatory changes in their host which could decrease epithelial permeability, which is highlighted as a potential mechanism through which helminths treat disease. Despite this, the influence of a chronic helminth infection on epithelial permeability remains unclear. This study uses the chronically infecting intestinal helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus to reveal alterations in the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins and epithelial permeability during the infection course. In the acute infection phase (1 week postinfection), an increase in intestinal epithelial permeability is observed. Consistent with this finding, jejunal claudin-2 is upregulated and tricellulin is downregulated. By contrast, in the chronic infection phase (6\u2009weeks postinfection), colonic claudin-1 is upregulated and epithelial permeability decreases. Importantly, this study also investigates changes in epithelial permeability in a small human cohort experimentally challenged with the human hookworm, Necator americanus. It demonstrates a trend toward small intestinal permeability increasing in the acute infection phase (8\u2009weeks postinfection), and colonic and whole gut permeability decreasing in the chronic infection phase (24\u2009weeks postinfection), suggesting a conserved epithelial response between humans and mice. In summary, our findings demonstrate dynamic changes in epithelial permeability during a chronic helminth infection and provide another plausible mechanism by which chronic helminth infections could be utilized to treat disease.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "04", "day": "22"}}, {"article_title": "A scan-specific quality control acquisition for clinical whole-body (WB) MRI protocols.", "article_abstract": "Image quality in whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) may be degraded by faulty radiofrequency (RF) coil elements or mispositioning of the coil arrays.

This work aimed to develop a scan-specific QC acquisition and processing pipeline to detect broken RF coil elements, which is sufficiently rapid to be added to the clinical WB-MRI protocol. The purpose of this is to improve the quality of WB-MRI by reducing the number of patient examinations conducted with suboptimal equipment.&#xD;Approach: A rapid acquisition (14 seconds additional acquisition time per imaging station) was developed that identifies broken RF coil elements by acquiring images from each individual coil element and using the integral body coil.

This study aimed to evaluate, in vitro, immunomodulatory potentials of the aqueous extracts of Chlorella vulgaris and Tetradesmus obliquus. Both microalgae extracts (ME) were obtained by sonication, and the selectivity index (SI) was determined by assays of inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) in T. cruzi trypomastigotes cells; as well as the cytotoxic concentrations (CC<sub>50</sub>) in human peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC). The immune response was evaluated in T. cruzi-infected PBMC using the IC<sub>50</sub> value.

Numerically, Brazil's representation comprised 229 women who, predominantly, had physical impairments and engaged in individual sports. In addition to a sporting legacy deeply entrenched in physical rehabilitation with limited opportunities for team-based sports, we observed negative influences stemming from ableist and sexist narratives.

However, it is still rare and challenging to achieve multifunctional capabilities such as material production, shape transformation, and sensing in a single-engineered living structure. In this study, we demonstrate bifunctional living structures by synergistically integrating cellulose-generating bacteria with pH-responsive hydrogels, and the entire structures can be precisely fabricated by three-dimensional (3D) printing. Such 3D-printed bifunctional living structures produce cellulose nanofibers in ambient conditions and have reversible and controlled shape-morphing properties (usually referred to as four-dimensional printing). Those functionalities make them biomimetic versions of silkworms in the sense that both can generate nanofibers and have body motion. We systematically investigate the processing-structure-property relationship of the bifunctional living structures. The on-demand separation of 3D cellulose structures from the hydrogel template and the living nature of the bacteria after processing and shape transformation are also demonstrated.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "04", "day": "22"}}, {"article_title": "Multifunctionality of arginine residues in the active sites of non-canonical d-amino acid transaminases.", "article_abstract": "Structure-function relationships are key to understanding enzyme mechanisms, controlling enzyme activities, and designing biocatalysts. Here, we investigate the functions of arginine residues in the active sites of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent non-canonical d-amino acid transaminases, focusing on the analysis of a transaminase from Haliscomenobacter hydrossis. Our results show that the tandem of arginine residues R28* and R90, which form the conserved R-[RK] motif in non-canonical d-amino acid transaminases, not only facilitates effective substrate binding but also regulates the catalytic properties of PLP. Non-covalent interactions between residues R28*, R90, and Y147 strengthen the hydrogen bond between Y147 and PLP, thereby maintaining the reactivity of the cofactor. Next, the R90 residue contributes to the stability of the holoenzyme. Finally, the R90I substitution induces structural changes that lead to substrate promiscuity, as evidenced by the effective binding of substrates with and without the \u03b1-carboxylate group. This study sheds light on the structural determinants of the activity of non-canonical d-amino acid transaminases.

Because there are very few therapeutic options for JEV infection, prompt investigations of the ability of clinically safe, efficacious and globally available drugs to inhibit JEV infection and ameliorate peripheral neuropathy are urgently needed. In this study, we found that high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin, a function inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMA), inhibited acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) and ceramide activity in the serum and sciatic nerve of JEV-infected rats, reduced disease severity, reversed electrophysiological and histological abnormalities, significantly reduced circulating proinflammatory cytokine levels, inhibited Th1 and Th17 cell proliferation, and suppressed the infiltration of inflammatory CD4\u00a0+\u00a0cells into the sciatic nerve. It also maintained the peripheral nerve-blood barrier without causing severe clinical side effects. In terms of the potential mechanisms, ASM was found to participate in immune cell differentiation and to activate immune cells, thereby exerting proinflammatory effects.

We utilized multiplexed fluorescence immunohistochemistry for profiling CAF landscape in metastatic and non-metastatic primary human cSCCs, in metastases, and in premalignant epidermal lesions. Quantitative high-resolution image analysis was performed with two separate panels of antibodies for CAF markers and results were correlated with clinical and histopathological parameters including disease-specific mortality. Increased stromal expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) were associated with progression to invasive cSCC.

DHA can be obtained from the diet or synthesized from alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3) via a series of desaturation and elongation reactions occurring in the liver. Tracer studies suggest that dietary DHA can downregulate its own synthesis, but the mechanism remains undetermined and is the primary objective of this paper. First, we show by tracing <sup>13</sup>C content (\u03b4<sup>13</sup>C) of DHA via compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA), that following low dietary DHA, the brain receives DHA synthesized from ALA. We then show that dietary DHA increases mouse liver and serum EPA, which is dependant on ALA. Furthermore, by CSIA we demonstrate that the source of increased EPA is slowed EPA metabolism, not increased DHA retroconversion as previously assumed. DHA feeding alone or with ALA lowered liver elongation of very long-chain (ELOVL2, EPA elongation) enzyme activity despite no change in protein content. To further evaluate the role of ELOVL2, a liver-specific Elovl2 knockout was generated showing that DHA feeding in the presence or absence of a functional liver ELOVL2 yields similar results. An enzyme competition assay for EPA elongation suggests both uncompetitive and non-competitive inhibition by DHA depending on DHA levels. To translate our findings, we show that DHA supplementation in men and women increases EPA levels in a manner dependent on a SNP (rs953413) in the ELOVL2 gene.

The administration of spermidine (SPD) has been shown to modulate major protein kinases associated with memory improvement, including the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase (PKC) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), key players in the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activation. Nevertheless, the initial mechanism underlying SPD-mediated memory consolidation remains unknown, as we hypothesize a potential involvement of the memory consolidation precursor, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-\u03b1 (CaMKII\u03b1), in this process. Based on this, our study aimed to investigate potential interactions among PKC, PKA, and CREB activation, mediated by CaMKII\u03b1 activation, in order to elucidate the SPD memory consolidation pathway. Our findings suggest that the post-training administration of the CaMKII inhibitor, KN-62 (0.25\u202fnmol, intrahippocampal), prevented the memory enhancement induced by SPD (0.2\u202fnmol, intrahippocampal) in the inhibitory avoidance task. Through western immunoblotting, we observed that phosphorylation of CaMKII\u03b1 in the hippocampus was facilitated 15\u202fmin after intrahippocampal SPD administration, resulting in the activation of PKA and CREB, 180\u202fmin after infusion, suggesting a possible sequential mechanism, since SPD with KN-62 infusion leads to a downregulation in CaMKII\u03b1/PKA/CREB pathway. However, KN-62 does not alter the memory-facilitating effect of SPD on PKC, possibly demonstrating a parallel cascade in memory acquisition via PKA, without modulating CAMKII\u03b1.

In T lymphocytes, SNX27 partners with diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase \u03b6 (DGK\u03b6) to facilitate polarized traffic and signaling at the immune synapse (IS).

This guarantees the adequate recruitment of Lck at the IS that is indispensable for subsequent activation of tyrosine phosphorylation regulated events.

This is reminiscent of the process commonly termed cytokine storm, a condition dependent on a disproportionated production of cytokines. This state involves the activation of the innate immune response by viral patterns and coincides with the biosynthesis of the biomass required for viral replication, which may overwhelm the capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum and drive the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is a signal transduction pathway composed of three branches that is initiated by a set of sensors: inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1), protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). These sensors control adaptive processes, including the transcriptional regulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Based on this background, the role of the UPR in SARS-CoV-2 replication and the ensuing inflammatory response was investigated using in vivo and in vitro models of infection. Mice and Syrian hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed a sole activation of the Ire1\u03b1-Xbp1 arm of the UPR associated with a robust production of proinflammatory cytokines. Human lung epithelial cells showed the dependence of viral replication on the expression of UPR-target proteins branching on the IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 arm and to a lower extent on the PERK route.

The present study investigated the role and the regulation of UHRF1 poly-ubiquitination induced by thymoquinone, a natural anti-cancer drug, known to enhance or re-activate the expression of TSGs. We found that the auto-ubiquitination of UHRF1, induced by TQ, is mediated by reactive oxygen species, and occurs following DNA damage. We demonstrated that the poly-ubiquitinated form of UHRF1 is K63-linked and can still silence the tumor suppressor gene p16<sup>INK4A</sup>/CDKN2A<sub>.</sub> We further showed that TQ-induced auto-ubiquitination is mediated via the activity of Tip60. Since this latter is known as a nuclear receptor co-factor, we investigated if the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) might be involved in the regulation of UHRF1 ubiquitination. Activation of the GR, with dexamethasone, did not influence auto-ubiquitination of UHRF1. However, we could observe that TQ induced a K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of GR, probably involved in the proteosomal degradation pathway. Mass-spectrometry analysis of FLAG-HA-tagged UHRF1 identified UHRF1 partners involved in DNA repair and showed that TQ increased their association with UHRF1, suggesting that poly-ubiquitination of UHRF1 is involved in the DNA repair process.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the critical role of circulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mediating cardiac dysfunction after bilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). We observed the diastolic dysfunction in the mice following renal IRI, accompanied by reduced ATP levels, oxidative stress, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) accumulation in the heart. Notably, ROS levels showed a sequential increase in the kidneys, circulation, and heart. Treatment with tempol, an ROS scavenger, significantly restored cardiac diastolic function in the renal IRI mice, corroborating the bridge role of circulating ROS. Accumulating evidence has identified oxidative stress as upstream of Mst1/Hippo in cardiac injury, which could regulate the expression of downstream genes related to mitochondrial quality control, leading to lower ATP, higher ROS and metabolic disorder. To verify this, we examined the activation of the Mst1/Hippo pathway in the heart of renal IRI mice, which was alleviated by tempol treatment as well. In vitro, analysis revealed that Mst1-knockdown cardiomyocytes could be activated by hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>).

Our results have shown a good agreement with previously measured electronic properties of the Ca<sub>2</sub>C and Cr<sub>2</sub>C MXene layers and the PBE DFT method.

Good biocompatibility and controllable drug release were demonstrated by in vitro experiments. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses confirmed the intracellular uptake of the nanocarriers by using doxorubicin (DOX) as a drug model and phenylboronic acid (PBA) as the targeting ligand.

One potential treatment target is the gut microbiome, but it is unknown if cocaine induces long-lasting effects on gut microbes. A novel therapeutic candidate for CUD, cannabidiol (CBD), can improve gut function in rodent models. It is possible that protective effects of CBD against cocaine use are mediated by improving gut health. We examined this question in this experiment. Cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) was conducted in adult male C57BL/6JArc mice. Mice were treated with vehicle or 20\u00a0mg/kg CBD prior to all cocaine CPP sessions (N\u00a0=\u00a011-13/group). Mice were tested drug free 1, 14 and 28\u00a0days after cessation of cocaine and CBD treatment. Fecal samples were collected prior to drug treatment and after each test session. Gut microbiome analyses were conducted using 16\u00a0s rRNA sequencing and correlated with behavioural parameters. We found a persistent preference for a cocaine-environment in mice, and long-lasting changes to gut microbe alpha diversity. Cocaine caused persistent changes to beta diversity which lasted for 4\u00a0weeks. CBD treatment reduced cocaine-environment preference during abstinence from cocaine and returned gut beta diversity measures to control levels. CBD treatment increased the relative abundance of Firmicutes phyla and Oscillospira genus, but decreased Bacteroidetes phyla and Bacteroides acidifaciens species. Preference score in cocaine-treated mice was positively correlated with abundance of Actinobacteria, whereas in mice treated with CBD and cocaine, the preference score was negatively correlated with Tenericutes abundance. Here we show that CBD facilitates cocaine extinction memory and reverses persistent cocaine-induced changes to gut microbe diversity. Furthermore, CBD increases the abundance of gut microbes which have anti-inflammatory properties. This suggests that CBD may act via the gut to reduce the memory of cocaine reward. Our data suggest that improving gut health and using CBD could limit cocaine abuse.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "04", "day": "20"}}, {"article_title": "Ceramic-on-Ceramic Total Hip Arthroplasty Using a Double Tapered, Proximally Coated Stem: 15 to 24-year Clinical and Radiologic Follow-up.", "article_abstract": "Total hip arthroplasty implant choice profoundly affects survivorship, complications, and failure modes.

Total glucosides of white paeony (TGP) capsule primarily contains extracts from the white peony root and has been shown to have various pharmacological effects, but its role in KOA still requires comprehensive evaluation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effect of TGP on knee cartilage and subchondral bone, as well as elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. The effect of TGP on KOA progression was evaluated in the destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM)-induced KOA model of mouse and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2-induced KOA model of primary mouse chondrocytes. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that TGP had a protective effect on the cartilage. Treatment with TGP could induce the synthesis of critical elements in the cartilage extracellular matrix and downregulate the synthesis of degrading enzymes in the extracellular matrix. Regarding the underlying mechanisms, TGP inhibited the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65 by regulating the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway. In addition, TGP could reduce the secretion of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Moreover, it has a sustained effect on coupled subchondral bone remodeling through regulation of the OPG/RANKL/RANK pathway.

However, the effect of BPA on sulfur transformation, particularly toxic H<sub>2</sub>S production, has been previously overlooked. This work found that BPA at environmentally relevant levels (i.e., 50-200 mg/kg total suspended solids, TSS) promoted the release of soluble sulfur compounds and increased H<sub>2</sub>S gas production by 14.3-31.9%. The tryptophan-like proteins of microbe extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) can spontaneously adsorb BPA, which is an enthalpy-driven reaction (\u0394<i>H</i> = -513.5 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, \u0394<i>S</i> = -1.60 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>K <sup>-1</sup>, and \u0394<i>G</i> = -19.52 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> at 35 \u00b0C). This binding changed the composition and structure of EPSs, which improved the direct electron transfer capacity of EPSs, thereby promoting the bioprocesses of organic sulfur hydrolysis and sulfate reduction. In addition, BPA presence enriched the functional microbes (e.g., <i>Desulfovibrio</i> and <i>Desulfuromonas</i>) responsible for organic sulfur mineralization and inorganic sulfate reduction and increased the abundance of related genes involved in ATP-binding cassette transporters and sulfur metabolism (e.g., <i>Sat</i> and <i>AspB</i>), which promoted anaerobic sulfur transformation.

Emerging evidence points to the involvement of the transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel in neuron death and glial activation in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the involvement of TRPM2 in PD and specifically its relation to the neuroinflammation aspect of the disease remains poorly understood. Here, we hypothesized that AG490, a TRPM2 inhibitor, can be used as a treatment in a mouse model of PD. Mice underwent stereotaxic surgery for 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) administration in the right striatum. Motor behavioral tests (apomorphine, cylinder, and rotarod) were performed on day 3 post-injection to confirm the PD model induction. AG490 was then daily injected i.p. between days 3 to 6 after surgery. On day 6, motor behavior was assessed again. Substantia nigra (SNc) and striatum (CPu) were collected for immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and RT-qPCR analysis on day 7. Our results revealed that AG490 post-treatment reduced motor behavior impairment and nigrostriatal neurodegeneration. In addition, the compound prevented TRPM2 upregulation and changes of the Akt/GSK-3\u03b2/caspase-3 signaling pathway. The TRPM2 inhibition also avoids the glial morphology changes observed in the PD group. Remarkably, the morphometrical analysis revealed that the ameboid-shaped microglia, found in 6-OHDA-injected animals, were no longer present in the AG490-treated group. These results indicate that AG490 treatment can reduce dopaminergic neuronal death and suppress neuroinflammation in a PD mouse model.

After a 100-day feeding trial, dietary AA levels did not significantly affect the survival, weight gain, daily increment in shell length, and feed conversion ratio of Pacific abalone. The expression of GLO in the kidney was downregulated by dietary AA. These results implied that the ability to synthesize AA in abalone had not been lost. From the evolutionary perspective, the loss of GLO occurred independently as an independent event by matching with the genomes of various species. The positive selection analysis revealed that the GLO gene underwent purifying selective pressure during its evolution. In conclusion, the present study provided direct evidence to prove that the GLO activity and the ability to synthesize AA exist in abalone.

The present work studied the morphometrical variation of Triatoma infestans legs, the main vector of Chagas disease the Southern Cone of South America. We described morphometric traits and the natural variation of each leg segment. Different linear, size and shape variables of each component of the three right legs of fifth instar nymphs of T. infestans were analyzed using morphometric tools. We analyzed differentiation, variation and correlation for each segment across the fore-, mid and hind legs using different statistical approaches such as general linear model, canonical variates analysis, test of equality of coefficient of variation and partial least square analysis. We also analyzed variation and correlation between segments within each leg with partial least square and morphometric disparity analyses. Our results showed that the segments differed between legs, as general trends, the dimensions (length, width and/or size) were greater in the hind legs, smaller in the forelegs and intermediate in the mid ones. The femur and tibia (length and/or width) showed differences in morphometric variation between legs and the femur and tibia showed the highest levels of correlation between legs. On the other hand, in the fore- and mid legs, the femur (length or width) showed similar variation with tibia and tarsus lengths, but in the hind legs, the femur showed similar variation with all segments and not with the tibia length, and there were strong correlations between linear measurement within each leg. Our results suggest that the femur and tibia could play a determining role in the coordination between the legs that determines the walking pattern.

Using calorimetric methods, we show that the surface energy is negative in some prototypical colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, or quantum dots with organic ligand coatings.

We performed a comparative proteomic analysis on O157:H7 before and after undergoing soil dry-wet alternation. A differential expression of 820 proteins was identified in resuscitated cells compared to exponential-phase cells, as determined by proteomics analysis. The GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed that up-regulated proteins were associated with oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, ribosome activity, and transmembrane transporters, indicating increased energy production and protein synthesis in resuscitated O157:H7. Moreover, proteins related to acid, osmotic, heat, oxidative, antibiotic stress and horizontal gene transfer efficiency were up-regulated, suggesting a potential improvement in stress resistance. Subsequent validation experiments demonstrated that the survival rates of the resuscitated cells were 476.54 and 7786.34 times higher than the exponential-phase cells, with pH levels of 1.5 and 2.5, respectively.

The results revealed that QUE (0.5 or 1.0 g/kg) ameliorated the growth, and the expressions of genes related to apoptosis, antioxidant, and immunity. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differential metabolites (DMs) obtained through transcriptomics and metabolomics, respectively, enriched in pathways related to nutritional metabolism such as lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. After QUE addition, especially at 0.5 g/kg, DEGs were enriched into the functions of response to stimulus and antioxidant activity, and the pathways of HIF-1 signaling pathway, C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and FoxO signaling pathway. In conclusion, dietary QUE can ameliorate growth, apoptosis, antioxidant and immunity of P. vannamei, the appropriate addition amount was 0.5 g/kg rather than 1.0 g/kg. Regulations of QUE on nutrient metabolism and immune-related pathways, and bioactive metabolites, were important factors for improving the aforementioned abilities in P. vannamei.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "04", "day": "20"}}, {"article_title": "Effect of radiotherapy on local control and overall survival in spinal metastasis of non-small-cell lung cancer after surgery and systemic therapy.", "article_abstract": "Radiotherapy is a well-known local treatment for spinal metastases.

Hydrothermal treatment represents an alternative technology for treating sludge to recover energy and other valuable products. In this study, 15 PFAS were determined in sludge and hydrochar substrates using sonication-solid phase extraction procedure and analyzed using LC-Orbitrap-High Resolution-MS/MS. The method was fully validated, exhibiting very good linearity, recoveries in the range of 48 to 126\u00a0%, low detection and quantification limits with expanded uncertainty and precision below 32\u00a0% and 21.9\u00a0%, respectively.

To address this issue, we design a framework containing improved data fusion method, novel grey incidence models and air pollution spatiotemporal analysis to analyze the complex characteristics of air pollution under the fusion of multiple factors. Firstly, we improve the existing data fusion method for multi-factor fusion. Subsequently, we construct two grey spatiotemporal incidence models to examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of multi-factorial air pollution in network relationships and changing trends. Furthermore, we propose two new properties that can manifest the performance of grey incidence analysis, and we provide detailed proof of the properties of the new models. Finally, in the Jing-Jin-Ji region, the novel models are used to study the network relationships and trend changes of air pollution. The findings are as follows: (1) Two highly polluted belts in the region require attention.

These mutations are either classified as missense mutations or truncation mutations. One mutation whose nature has been inconsistently reported in the literature is the MYBPC3-c.772G\u00a0>\u00a0A mutation. Using patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated to cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), we have performed a mechanistic study of the structure-function relationship for this MYBPC3-c.772G\u00a0>\u00a0A mutation versus a mutation corrected, isogenic cell line. Our results confirm that this mutation leads to exon skipping and mRNA truncation that ultimately suggests \u223c20% less cMyBP-C protein (i.e., haploinsufficiency). This, in turn, results in increased myosin recruitment and accelerated myofibril cycling kinetics. Our mechanistic studies suggest that faster ADP release from myosin is a primary cause of accelerated myofibril cross-bridge cycling due to this mutation. Additionally, the reduction in force generating heads expected from faster ADP release during isometric contractions is outweighed by a cMyBP-C phosphorylation mediated increase in myosin recruitment that leads to a net increase of myofibril force, primarily at submaximal calcium activations. These results match well with our previous report on contractile properties from myectomy samples of the patients from whom the hiPSC-CMs were generated, demonstrating that these cell lines are a good model to study this pathological mutation and extends our understanding of the mechanisms of altered contractile properties of this HCM MYBPC3-c.772G\u00a0>\u00a0A mutation.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "04", "day": "20"}}, {"article_title": "A potential virulence factor: Brucella flagellin FliK does not affect the main biological properties but inhibits the inflammatory response in RAW264.7 cells.", "article_abstract": "The bacterial flagellum is an elongated filament that protrudes from the cell and is responsible for bacterial motility. It can also be a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that regulates the host immune response and is involved in bacterial pathogenicity. In contrast to motile bacteria, the Brucella flagellum does not serve a motile purpose. Instead, it plays a role in regulating Brucella virulence and the host's immune response, similar to other non-motile bacteria. The flagellin protein, FliK, plays a key role in assembly of the flagellum and also as a potential virulence factor involved in the regulation of bacterial virulence and pathogenicity. In this study, we generated a Brucella suis S2 flik gene deletion strain and its complemented strain and found that deletion of the flik gene has no significant effect on the main biological properties of Brucella, but significantly enhanced the inflammatory response induced by Brucella infection of RAW264.7 macrophages. Further experiments demonstrated that the FliK protein was able to inhibit LPS-induced cellular inflammatory responses by down-regulating the expression of MyD88 and NF-\u03baB, and by decreasing p65 phosphorylation in the NF-\u03baB pathway; it also inhibited the expression of NLRP3 and caspase-1 in the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.

The mucus layer is a crucial component of the colonic barrier, responsible for preventing harmful bacteria from invading the intestinal epithelium and causing inflammation.

Biochanin A (BCA), an isoflavonoid, has garnered increasing interest due to its significant biological activities. However, the impact of BCA on UC has not been reported yet. In this study, we used a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis model and the Muc2 deficient (Muc2<sup>-/-</sup>) mice spontaneous colitis model to explore the mechanisms of BCA in the treatment of UC. Here, we verified that DSS-induced UC was observably attenuated and spontaneous colitis in Muc2<sup>-/-</sup> mice was relieved by BCA. Treatment with BCA improved colitis-related symptoms and reduced intestinal permeability by upregulating the levels of goblet cells and tight junction (TJ) proteins. In addition, we confirmed that BCA promotes autophagy through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) pathway, thereby alleviating DSS-induced UC. In addition, the administration of BCA was able to reduce apoptosis and promote proliferation by suppressing Cleaved Caspase-3 (Cleaved Cas-3) expression, and increasing PCNA and Ki67 levels. Further research revealed that BCA treatment ameliorated spontaneous colitis and alleviated epithelial damage in Muc2<sup>-/-</sup> mice by restoring the intestinal barrier and promoting autophagy.

The gut microbiome is an important regulator of liver functions including xenobiotic biotransformation and immune regulation. We recently showed that neonatal exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ether-99 (BDE-99), a human breast milk-enriched PBDE congener, up-regulated pro-inflammation- and down-regulated drug metabolism-related genes predominantly in males in young adulthood. However, the persistence of dysregulation into late adulthood, differential impact of hepatic cell types, and the involvement of the gut microbiome from neonatal BDE-99 exposure remains unknown. To address these knowledge gaps, male C57BL/6 mouse pups were orally exposed to corn oil (10\u2009ml/kg) or BDE-99 (57\u2009mg/kg) once daily from postnatal days 2-4. At 15\u2009months of age, neonatal BDE-99 exposure down-regulated xenobiotic and lipid metabolizing enzymes and up-regulated genes involved in microbial influx in hepatocytes. Neonatal BDE-99 exposure also increased the hepatic proportion of neutrophils and led to a predicted increase of macrophage migration inhibitory factor signaling. This was associated with decreased intestinal tight junction protein (Tjp) transcripts, altered gut environment, and dysregulation of inflammation-related metabolites. ScRNA-seq using germ-free (GF) mice demonstrated the necessity of a normal gut microbiome in maintaining hepatic immune tolerance. Microbiota transplant to GF mice using large intestinal microbiome from adults neonatally exposed to BDE-99 down-regulated Tjp transcripts and up-regulated several cytokines in the large intestine. In conclusion, neonatal BDE-99 exposure reprogrammed cell type-specific gene expression and communication in liver towards pro-inflammation, and BDE-99-mediated pro-inflammatory signatures may be partly due to the dysregulated gut environment.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "04", "day": "22"}}, {"article_title": "Psychometric Properties of the Metacognitions About Online Gaming Scale in the Chinese Population and Its Relationship With Internet Gaming Disorder: Cross-Sectional Study.", "article_abstract": "Metacognitions about online gaming have been shown to be correlated with Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD).

However, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the emission characteristics of NH<sub>3</sub> from vehicles. This study conducted real-world driving emission (RDE) measurements and dynamometer measurements on 33 light-duty gasoline vehicles (LDGVs) to investigate their emission characteristics and impact factors. The tested vehicles include China 3 to China 6 emission standards. The results show that the average NH<sub>3</sub> emission factors of LDGVs decreased by >80\u00a0% from China 3 to China 6 emission standards. The results obtained from dynamometer measurements reveal that independent from other conventional pollutants (such as HCHO and NOx), NH<sub>3</sub> emissions do not exhibit significant emission peaks during the hot- or cold-start phase. The RDE measurement covers a more comprehensive range of the vehicle's real-world driving conditions, resulting in higher NH<sub>3</sub> emission factors compared with dynamometer measurements. The analysis of RDE measurements revealed that NH<sub>3</sub> emissions are influenced by vehicle speeds and accelerations. Acceleration processes contribute approximately 50\u00a0% of total NH<sub>3</sub> emissions over a driving period. Finally, using real driving speed, acceleration, and road gradient as input parameters, an NH<sub>3</sub> emission rate model based on vehicle specific power was developed.

The surge in non-traditional metals like cobalt as emerging contaminant within IFA samples further attracts to address this issue. In response, the hydrometallurgical recycling of a cobalt-bearing IFA has been studied. Thereby, approximately 98\u00a0% zinc and 96\u00a0% cobalt were leached using a 1.0\u00a0mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution at 90\u00a0\u00b0C and 1\u00a0h of leaching time. In-depth analysis of the leaching process unveiled metals' dissolution primarily via the ion-exclusion mechanism, as evidenced by lower diffusion coefficients (between 10<sup>-9</sup> and 10<sup>-11</sup>\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>/s) and activation energies (9.6-14.9\u00a0kJ/mol). Above 99\u00a0% separation of zinc from the cobalt-bearing leach liquor was achieved by extraction with 1.0\u00a0mol/L D2EHPA at an equilibrium pH below 3.0, followed by stripping with a 2.0\u00a0mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution.

Atmospheric ethanol median concentrations in S\u00e3o Paulo (SP) (12.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.1 ppbv) and Ribeir\u00e3o Preto (RP) (12.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.9 ppbv) were remarkably close, despite the SP vehicular fleet being \u223c13 times larger.

This work demonstrated the importance of evaporative emissions, together with biomass burning, as sources of the compounds studied. The importance of biogenic emissions of methanol during forest flooding was identified in campaigns in the Amazon and Atlantic forests. Marine air masses arriving at a coastal site led to the lowest concentrations of ethanol measured in this work.

Once heterologous metabolic pathways have been introduced into host cells, traditional metabolic engineering techniques are employed to enhance the productivity and yield of PNP biosynthetic routes, as well as to manage competing pathways. The advent of computational biology has marked the beginning of a novel epoch in strain design through in silico methods. These methods utilize genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) and flux optimization algorithms to facilitate rational design across the entire cellular metabolic network. However, the implementation of in silico strategies can often result in an uneven distribution of metabolic fluxes due to the rigid knocking out of endogenous genes, which can impede cell growth and ultimately impact the accumulation of target products. In this study, we creatively utilized synthetic biology to refine in silico strain design for efficient PNPs production. OptKnock simulation was performed on the GEM of Saccharomyces cerevisiae OA07, an engineered strain for oleanolic acid (OA) bioproduction that has been reported previously. The simulation predicted that the single deletion of fol1, fol2, fol3, abz1, and abz2, or a combined knockout of hfd1, ald2 and ald3 could improve its OA production. Consequently, strains EK1\u223cEK7 were constructed and cultivated. EK3 (OA07\u25b3fol3), EK5 (OA07\u25b3abz1), and EK6 (OA07\u25b3abz2) had significantly higher OA titers in a batch cultivation compared to the original strain OA07. However, these increases were less pronounced in the fed-batch mode, indicating that gene deletion did not support sustainable OA production. To address this, we designed a negative feedback circuit regulated by malonyl-CoA, a growth-associated intermediate whose synthesis served as a bypass to OA synthesis, at fol3, abz1, abz2, and at acetyl-CoA carboxylase-encoding gene acc1, to dynamically and autonomously regulate the expression of these genes in OA07. The constructed strains R_3A, R_5A and R_6A had significantly higher OA titers than the initial strain and the responding gene-knockout mutants in either batch or fed-batch culture modes. Among them, strain R_3A stand out with the highest OA titer reported to date. Its OA titer doubled that of the initial strain in the flask-level fed-batch cultivation, and achieved at 1.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0g\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> in 96\u00a0h in the fermenter-level fed-batch mode.

Twenty-four (n = 24) athletes participated, and their omega-3 status was assessed using the Omega-3 Index (O3I) and arachidonic acid (AA) to EPA ratio through finger-prick blood samples taken at the start and end of the season. They were given access to a fish oil supplement (PILLAR Performance, Australia) with a recommended daily dose of four capsules per day (2,160\u00a0mg EPA and 1,440\u00a0mg docosahexaenoic acid). At the beginning of the season, the group mean O3I was 4.77% (95% confidence interval [CI: 4.50, 5.04]) and the AA to EPA ratio was 14.89 (95% CI [13.22, 16.55]).

Qinghe County has a climate of drought, cold, strong winds, and high altitude. After sand and iron mining, the soil in this area contains a large amount of sand and gravel with extremely low organic matter, nitrogen deficiency, and a high pH of 9.26. Our preliminary studies disclosed that only three plants, including Caligonum junceum, Atraphaxis virgata, and Melilotus albus Medic, can grow naturally in this environment without any artificial management. For effective ecology restoration, this study explored the mechanism of plant-microbial interaction and stress resistance in this environment. It was found that although the soil condition in the sand iron ore landfill area is extreme, the bacterial diversity remained high, with Shannon and Simpson indices reaching 9.135 and 0.994, respectively. The planting of three types of remediation plants did not significantly improve, or even decreased, the soil bacterial diversity index, but greatly changed the composition of dominant bacterial genera. Significant differences in the composition of rhizosphere soil bacterial communities among these three remediation plants were observed. Potential new bacterial species accounted for 9.8\u202f%, and the proportion of unique genera reached 30\u202f% or 50\u202f%, respectively. Among all the isolated strains, 74\u202f% had nitrogen fixation and other growth-promoting properties. In summary, the soil microbial community structure in this extreme environment is unique and diverse. The types of remediation plants play a major role in the composition of the rhizosphere bacterial community structure, and the recruited growth-promoting bacteria are diverse and functional.

The main reasons for this situation include both the approach to TB care and the concentration of TB cases in prisons. The neoliberal approach to TB care system reform promises the optimization of treatment terms, \"dehospitalization\" and \"despecialization\" of the system of care, and a different type of control, established through digital technologies. One such technology is the \"e-TB Manager\", which was designated as a national TB registry, including in the prison system in 2012. In prison, where everyone \"is to be fixed\" and isolated, the uncertainty of patients' movements seems to be avoided by pre-existing conditions. In practice, however, the vertically aligned, centralized organizational structure of the post-Soviet prison implies a constant need to link its elements together through \"coerced\" mobility carried out in secrecy. Treatment in exile may not be the primary goal of such a practice, but it becomes the result when prisoners from numerous prison facilities are sent to a limited number of prison TB hospitals. The integration of the e-TB Manager as a tool to enable the tracking of patient movements and, consequently, improve the efficiency of diagnostic and treatment processes in prison, can be seen as both a purely technical measure and a \"magic bullet\". In this article, we argue that, in the case of Ukrainian prisons, the neoliberal approach and the Soviet socialist approach to gaining control over TB indeed adapt and reinforce each other but fail to compete meaningfully. The fragmented implementation of one is absorbed by the fundamental and resilient nature of the other to produce and reproduce the state of \"post-Soviet limbo\". We use the \"post-Soviet limbo\" as an overall framework aimed at conceptualizing the post-Soviet transformation as a combination of efforts to avoid and manage the uncertainty of TB treatment, especially in prison. We examine the empirical case of coerced mobility of prisoners who require TB treatment, seeking to trace how this process is reflected in the e-TB Manager. We provide a more in-depth picture of this journey with details gathered from qualitative research materials to situate numbers and variables in their contexts, deconstructing the way the data are recorded according to the logic of the system in which they are produced.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "04", "day": "16"}}, {"article_title": "Upgrading anode graphite from retired lithium ion batteries via solid-phase exfoliation by mechanochemical strategy.", "article_abstract": "Vast quantities of anode graphite from waste lithium ion batteries (LIBs), as a type of underrated urban mine, has enormous potential to be exploited for resource recovery. Herein, we propose a benign process integrating low-temperature pyrolysis and mechanochemical techniques to upcycle spent graphite (SG) from end-of-life LIBs. Pyrolysis at 500\u00a0\u00b0C leads to about 82.2\u00a0% PVDF dissociation in thermal treated graphite (TG). Solid-phase exfoliation via ball milling assisted by urea successfully produces abundant graphite flakes and a small amount of monolayer graphene nanosheet at the edge of mechanochemically processed graphite (MG). Subsequent rinsing removes the residual LiF salts. High purity and unique edge structural features of the as-prepared MG offer more active sites and storage reservoir for intercalation and de-intercalation of lithium ions, resulting in enhanced lithium-ion diffusion kinetics, excellent reversible specific capacity and desirable rate capability. Inspiringly, MG exhibits a remarkably enhanced initial specific charge capacity of 521.3 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> during the first charge-discharge, and only declines from 569.9 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> to 538 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> with slight attenuation after 50 consecutive cycles at 0.1 A/g, indicating satisfactory cycle stability.

Charge carrier transport within the cells is governed by solid-solid contacts, emphasizing the importance of well-designed interfaces. A key parameter for enhancing the interfacial contacts among electrode active materials and electrolytes comprises externally applied pressure onto the cell stack, particularly in the case of ceramic electrolytes. Reports exploring the impact of external pressure on polymer-based cells are, however, scarce due to overall better wetting behavior. In this work, the consequences of externally applied pressure in view of key performance indicators, including cell longevity, rate capability, and limiting current density in single-layer pouch-type NMC622||Li cells, are evaluated employing cross-linked poly(ethylene oxide), xPEO, and cross-linked cyclodextrin grafted poly(caprolactone), xGCD-PCL. Notably, externally applied pressure substantially changes the cell's electrochemical cycling performance, strongly depending on the mechanical properties of the considered polymers. Higher external pressure potentially enhances electrode-electrolyte interfaces, thereby boosting the rate capability of pouch-type cells, despite the fact that the cell longevity may be reduced upon plastic deformation of the polymer electrolytes when passing beyond intrinsic thresholds of compressive stress. For the softer xGCD-PCL membrane, cycling of cells is only feasible in the absence of external pressure, whereas in the case of xPEO, a trade-off between enhanced rate capability and minimal membrane deformation is achieved at cell pressures of \u22640.43 MPa, which is considerably lower and more practical compared to cells employing ceramic electrolytes with \u22655 MPa external pressure.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "04", "day": "22"}}, {"article_title": "Carotid Endarterectomy and Transcarotid Artery Revascularization can be Performed with Acceptable Morbidity and Mortality in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.", "article_abstract": "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are considered a high-risk population, and the optimal approach to the treatment of carotid disease remains unclear.

However, present data seem to be limited to a specific community, obscuring the viewpoint of entire N-acquiring microbiomes and functions. Taking maize intercropped with legumes (peanut and soybean) and non-legumes (gingelly and sweet potato) as models, we studied the effects of intercropping on N transformations and N-acquiring microbiomes in rhizosphere soil across four maize growth stages. Meanwhile, we compiled promising strategies such as random forest analysis and structural equation model for the exploitation of the associations between microbe-driven N dynamics and soil-plant N trade-offs and maize productivity. Compared with monoculture, maize intercropping significantly increased the denitrification rate of rhizosphere soils across four maize growth stages, net N mineralization in the elongation and flowering stages, and the nitrification rate in the seedling and mature stages. The abundance of most N-acquiring microbial populations was influenced significantly by intercropping patterns and maize growth stages. Soil available N components (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N, and dissolved organic N content) showed a highly direct effect on plant N uptake, which mainly mediated by N transformations (denitrification rate) and N-acquiring populations (amoB, nirK3, and hzsB genes). Overall, the adaptation of N-acquiring microbiomes to changing rhizosphere micro-environments caused by intercropping patterns and maize development could promote soil N transformations and dynamics to meet demand of maize for N nutrient.

Computed tomography (CT) could be a powerful tool for device monitoring, but polymers require incorporation of radiopaque contrast agents to be distinguishable from tissue. In addition, immune response to radiopaque devices must be characterized as it modulates device function. Radiopaque devices and films were produced by incorporating 0-20wt% TaO<sub>x</sub> nanoparticles into polymers: polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). In vitro inflammatory responses of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages to polymer matrix incorporating TaO<sub>x</sub> nanoparticles was determined by monitoring cytokine secretion. Nanoparticle addition stimulated a slight inflammatory reaction, increasing TNF\u03b1 secretion, mediated by changes in polymer matrix properties. Subsequently, devices (PLGA 50:50+20wt% TaO<sub>x</sub>) were implanted subcutaneously in a mouse model of chronic inflammation, that featured a sustained increase in inflammatory response local to the implant site over 12 weeks. No changes to device degradation rates or foreign body response were noted between a normal and chronically stimulated inflammatory environment. Serial CT device monitoring post-implantation provided a detailed timeline of device collapse, with no rapid, spontaneous release of nanoparticles that occluded matrix visualization. Importantly, repeat CT sessions did not ablate the immune system or alter degradation kinetics. Thus, polymer devices incorporating radiopaque nanoparticles can be used for in situ monitoring and be readily combined with other medical imaging techniques, for a dynamic view biomaterial and tissue interactions. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: A growing number of implantable devices are in use in the clinic, exposing patients to inherent risks of implant movement, collapse, and infection. The ability to monitor implanted devices would enable faster diagnosis of failure and open the door for personalized rehabilitation therapies - both of which could vastly improve patient outcomes. Unfortunately, polymeric materials which make up most biomedical devices are not radiologically distinguishable from tissue post-implantation. The introduction of radiopaque nanoparticles into polymers allows for serial monitoring via computed tomography, without affecting device degradation. Here we demonstrate for the first time that nanoparticles do not undergo burst release from devices post-implantation and that inflammatory responses - a key determinant of device function in vivo - are also unaffected by nanoparticle addition.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "04", "day": "20"}}, {"article_title": "Efficient co-stabilization of arsenic and cadmium in farmland soil by schwertmannite under long-term flooding-drying condition.", "article_abstract": "Simultaneously stabilizing of arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) in co-contaminated soil presents substantial challenges due to their contrasting chemical properties. Schwertmannite (Sch) is recognized as a potent adsorbent for As pollution, with alkali modification showing promising results in the simultaneous immobilization of both As and Cd. This study systematically investigated the long-term stabilization efficacy of alkali-modified Sch in Cd-As co-contaminated farmland soil over a 200-day flooding-drying period. The results revealed that As showed significant mobility in flooded conditions, whereas Cd exhibited increased soil availability under drying phases. The addition of Sch did not affect the trends in soil pH and Eh fluctuations; nonetheless, it led to an augmentation in the levels of amorphous iron oxides and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentration in soil pore water. At a dosage of 0.5% Sch, there was a notable decrease in the mobility and soil availability of As and Cd under both flooding (34.5% and 53.6% at Day 50) and drying conditions (27.0% and 29.4% at Day 130), primarily promoting the transformation of labile metal(loid) fraction into amorphous iron oxide-bound forms. Throughout the flooding-drying treatment period, Sch maintained stable mineral morphology and mineralogical phase, highlighting its long-term stabilization effect. The findings of this study emphasize the promising application of Sch-based soil remediation agents in mitigating the challenges arising from As-Cd co-contamination.

For this, a controlled community trial carried out in 2023 was conducted, comprising intervention groups: Support Group (SG), mhGAP Group (mhGAPG) and a Control Group (CG). Self-report measurements were collected pretest and posttest, utilizing the Psychosocial Disability Scale and the Alberta Continuity of Care Scale. The study involved the participation of 94 individuals with a history of suicidal behavior, with 30 individuals in the SG, 34 in the mhGAP group, and 30 in the CG. Categorical variables were summarized using frequency distribution tables. Descriptive statistics were used to examine participants' characteristics at the study outcome and estimate treatment compliance. The Mann-Whitney U Test examined differences in sociodemographic variable frequencies. The Jarque-Bera test confirmed a normal distribution for psychological variables, warranting the use of parametric tests. Differences in mean values across groups, each with two measurements per individual, were assessed using a type II repeated measures ANOVA.

Here, we predicted changes in habitat area and structure for 39 common shorebird species along the coasts of the Yellow and Bohai Seas using a cellular automata-Markov (CA-Markov) land use scenario model and a maximum entropy species distribution model, along with terrain factors (slope, aspect, and digital evaluation model) and climate factors (temperature and precipitation) from the Data Centre for Resources and Environmental Sciences at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, land cover maps interpreted using the human-computer interactive method, and citizen science data of shorebird occurrences derived from eBird, Global Biodiversity Information Facility, and Bird Report. We found that shorebird habitat was most abundant along the coasts of Bohai Bay, Laizhou Bay, and Yancheng. The area of habitat decreased and became increasingly fragmented between 2000 and 2020 for more than half of the 39 species. Under the future business-as-usual scenario, the area of shorebird habitat decreased from 2020 to 2050, and the remaining habitat became increasingly fragmented. Under the ecological protection (EP) scenario, habitat loss was mitigated, and habitat connectivity was improved. The area of habitat was lower in 2050 under the EP scenario than in 2000 for most species, especially threatened species, suggesting that the area of habitat will not return to year-2000 levels under the EP scenario.

A total of 17 laboratories (81%) responded. The answers revealed a generally uniform approach to managing critical results, with all laboratories having 24-h reporting, local instructions and using the telephone as communication channel.

Additionally, yeast cells can utilize different mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways to modulate gene expression during stress conditions. Here, we show that the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) MAPK pathway is involved in the regulation of yeast flocculation. We observed that the HOG MAPK pathway was constitutively activated in flocculating cells, and found that the interaction between phosphorylated Hog1 and the FLO genes promoter region increased significantly upon sodium chloride exposure. We found that treatment of cells with cantharidin decreased Hog1 phosphorylation, causing a sharp reduction in the expression of FLO genes and the flocculation phenotype.

When one or more covariates are causally affected by both genetic variants and hidden confounders, adjusting for them in GWAS will produce biased estimation of SNP effects, known as collider bias. Several approaches have been developed to correct collider bias through estimating the bias by Mendelian randomization (MR). However, these methods work for only one covariate, some of which utilize MR methods with relatively strong assumptions, both of which may not hold in practice. In this paper, we extend the bias-correction approaches in two aspects: first we derive an analytical expression for the collider bias in the presence of multiple covariates, then we propose estimating the bias using a robust multivariable MR (MVMR) method based on constrained maximum likelihood (called MVMR-cML), allowing the presence of invalid instrumental variables (IVs) and correlated pleiotropy. We also established the estimation consistency and asymptotic normality of the new bias-corrected estimator. We conducted simulations to show that all methods mitigated collider bias under various scenarios.

The flexibility of the model is enhanced by constructing the adaptive relationship graph in a data-driven way, enabling adaptation to various data samples without the need for predefined additional constraints. The feature representation is further enhanced by aggregating the outputs of the ARGR module. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FARN achieves promising performance in detecting 37 anatomical structures across key US planes in tertiary obstetric screening. FARN effectively utilizes key relationships to improve detection performance, demonstrates robustness to small-scale, similar, and indistinct structures, and avoids some detection errors that deviate from anatomical norms. Overall, our study serves as a resource for developing efficient and concise approaches to model inter-anatomy relationships.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "04", "day": "22"}}, {"article_title": "Fully Sparse Fusion for 3D Object Detection.", "article_abstract": "Currently prevalent multi-modal 3D detection methods rely on dense detectors that usually use dense Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps. However, the cost of such BEV feature maps is quadratic to the detection range, making it not scalable for long-range detection. Recently, LiDAR-only fully sparse architecture has been gaining attention for its high efficiency in long-range perception. In this paper, we study how to develop a multi-modal fully sparse detector. Specifically, our proposed detector integrates the well-studied 2D instance segmentation into the LiDAR side, which is parallel to the 3D instance segmentation part in the LiDAR-only baseline. The proposed instance-based fusion framework maintains full sparsity while overcoming the constraints associated with the LiDAR-only fully sparse detector. Our framework showcases state-of-the-art performance on the widely used nuScenes dataset, Waymo Open Dataset, and the long-range Argoverse 2 dataset.

In this article, we proposed a scalable attentive transfer framework (SATF) for efficient MARL, which achieved goals faster and more accurately in homogeneous and heterogeneous combat tasks by transferring learned knowledge from a small number of agents (4) to a large number of agents (up to 64). To reduce and align the dimensionality of the observed state variations caused by increasing numbers of agents, the proposed SATF deployed a novel state representation network with a self-attention mechanism, known as dynamic observation representation network (DorNet), to extract the dominant observed information with excellent cost-effectiveness. The experiments on the MAgent platform showed that the SATF outperformed the distributed MARL (independent Q-learning (IQL) and A2C) in task sequences from 8 to 64 agents. The experiments on StarCraft II showed that the SATF demonstrated superior performance relative to the centralized training with decentralized execution MARL (QMIX) by presenting shorter training steps, achieving a desired win rate of up to approximately 90% when increasing the number of agents from 4 to 32.

Second, an adaptive controller is constructed to actuate the parabolic MAS to reach consensus under external disturbances.

Moreover, by designing a self-regulation triggered condition based on the tracking error, the intermediate triggered signal is calculated to replace the continuous signal in the controller, so as to achieve the goal of discontinuous update of the controller signal, and this mechanism does not need to add additional compensation function to the controller signal. At the same time, the funnel method is adopted to restrict the error of step n and avoid the possible negative impact caused by control signal. Furthermore, the nonlinear noncontinuous faults are compensated by the disturbance observer. Then, the Lyapunov stability theorem is used to prove that all signals of the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB).

We sampled squash leaves at 3 different dates each year and constructed a collection of cultivable bacterial strains isolated from squash leaves and rye cover crop material. Each isolated strain was identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and used in in vitro (Petri dish) pathogen growth and in vivo (greenhouse) symptom control assays.

Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal degradation process that is frequently blocked during cancer progression. It is an urgent need to determine the novel autophagy-associated regulators in NSCLC. Here, we found that pirin was upregulated in NSCLC, and its expression was positively correlated with poor prognosis. Overexpression of pirin inhibited autophagy and promoted NSCLC proliferation. We then performed data-independent acquisition-based quantitative proteomics to identify the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in pirin-overexpression (OE) or pirin-knockdown (KD) cells. Among the pirin-regulated DEPs, ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) was downregulated in pirin-KD cells while upregulated along with pirin overexpression. ODC1 depletion reversed the pirin-induced autophagy inhibition and pro-proliferation effect in A549 and H460 cells. Immunohistochemistry showed that ODC1 was highly expressed in NSCLC cancer tissues and positively related with pirin. Notably, NSCLC patients with pirin<sup>high</sup>/ODC1<sup>high</sup> had a higher risk in terms of overall survival. In summary, we identified pirin and ODC1 as a novel cluster of prognostic biomarkers for NSCLC and highlighted the potential oncogenic role of the pirin/ODC1/autophagy axis in this cancer type.

Down regulation of TaCAP1 expression led to decreased resistance against Pst, in contrast to increased resistance upon TaCAP1 overexpressing, as demonstrated by the changes of phenotypes and hyphal growth. We found increased expression of pathogenesis-responsive or relative related genes and disease grade changed in TaCAP1 overexpressing plants. Our results also showed TaCAP1-regulated host resistance to Pst by inducing the production and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mediating the salicylic acid signaling pathway.

In contrast, experimentally rodent hearts have been shown to be more resistant to IRI at the very early stages of diabetes induction than the heart of the non-diabetic control mice, and the mechanism is largely unclear. Ferroptosis has recently been shown to play an important role in myocardial IRI including that in diabetes, while the specific mechanisms are still unclear. Non-diabetic control (NC) and streptozotocin-induced diabetic (DM) mice were treated with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in drinking water for 4\u00a0week starting at 1\u00a0week after diabetes induction. Mice were subjected to myocardial IRI induced by occluding the coronary artery for 30\u00a0min followed by 2\u00a0h of reperfusion, subsequently at 1, 2, and 5\u00a0week of diabetes induction. The post-ischemic myocardial infarct size in the DM mice was smaller than that in NC mice at 1\u00a0week of diabetes but greater than that in the NC mice at 2 and 5\u00a0week of diabetes, which were associated with a significant increase of ferroptosis at 2 and 5\u00a0week but a significant reduction of ferroptosis at 1\u00a0week of diabetes. NAC significantly attenuated post-ischemic ferroptosis as well as oxidative stress and reduced infarct size at 2 and 5\u00a0week of diabetes. Application of erastin, a ferroptosis inducer, reversed the cardioprotective effects of NAC. It is concluded that increased oxidative stress and ferroptosis are the major factors attributable to the increased vulnerability to myocardial IRI in diabetes and that attenuation of ferroptosis represents a major mechanism whereby NAC confers cardioprotection against myocardial IRI in diabetes.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "04", "day": "22"}}, {"article_title": "Use of dose-volume histograms for metabolic response prediction in hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing transarterial radioembolization with Y-90 resin microspheres.", "article_abstract": "Voxel-based dosimetry offers improved outcomes in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with transarterial radioembolization (TARE) using glass microspheres.

CT images from 20 patients who underwent intensity-modulated radiotherapy were randomly chosen to create an atlas library. Atlas contours of the seven anatomical structures were generated using four software packages: ABAS, Eclipse, MIM, and RayStation. These contours were then compared to manual delineations performed by oncologists, which served as the ground truth. Evaluation metrics such as dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean distance to agreement (MDA), and volume ratio (VR) were calculated to assess the accuracy of the contours. Additionally, the time taken by each software to generate the atlas contour was recorded. The mean DSC values for the bladder exhibited strong agreement (>0.8) with manual delineations for all software except for Eclipse and RayStation. Similarly, the femoral heads showed significant similarity between the atlas contours and ground truth across all software, with mean DSC values exceeding 0.9 and MDA values close to zero. On the other hand, the penile bulb displayed only moderate agreement with the ground truth, with mean DSC values ranging from 0.5 to 0.7 for all software. A similar trend was observed in the prostate atlas contours, except for MIM, which achieved a mean DSC of over 0.8. For the rectum, both ABAS and MIM atlases demonstrated strong agreement with the ground truth, resulting in mean DSC values of more than 0.8.

It is known that MMAE is released from the ADC following binding, internalization and proteolytic degradation in target tissues. A striking discrepancy in systemic MMAE levels has been observed across species with 50-fold higher MMAE levels in human than that in rodents when normalized by ADC dose with unknown mechanism.<b>Hypothesis and purpose:</b> Multiple factors could affect systemic MMAE levels such as production and elimination of unconjugated MMAE following ADC dosing. In this study, we have explored whether MMAE displays differential red blood cell (RBC) partitioning across species that may contribute to the different MMAE levels seen between human and animals.<b>Experiments:</b> To determine MMAE RBC partitioning, tritium labeled MMAE ([<sup>3</sup>H]-MMAE) was incubated in whole blood from mice, rats, monkeys and humans <i>in vitro</i>, then RBC partitioning was determined and compared across species. To test whether MMAE released from the ADC would show any difference in RBC partitioning, pinatuzumab vedotin or polatuzumab vedotin was administered to mice, rats, and monkeys. MMAE levels were measured in both blood and plasma, and the ratios of MMAE levels were calculated as blood-to-plasma ratio (<i>in vivo</i> RBC partitioning).<b>Results:</b> Our <i>in vitro</i> data showed that unconjugated MMAE has a species-dependent RBC partitioning with strong RBC partitioning in mouse, rat, followed by monkey blood, whereas minimal RBC partitioning was seen in human blood. Incubation of 2\u2009nM of MMAE in mouse blood resulted in a blood-to-plasma ratio of 11.8\u2009\u00b1\u20090.291, followed by rat, monkey, and human at 2.36\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0825, 1.57\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0250, and 0.976\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0620, respectively. MMAE RBC partitioning is also concentration-dependent, with an inverse relationship between RBC partitioning and MMAE concentration (higher RBC partitioning at lower concentration). <i>In vivo</i> dosing of pinatuzumab vedotin in mouse displayed systemic MMAE at about a 5-fold higher blood concentration compared to plasma concentration once MMAE reached a pseudo-equilibrium, while systemic MMAE from blood and plasma concentration showed a 1.65-fold difference in rat.<b>Implication and conclusion:</b> These data demonstrated that MMAE has a distinct RBC partitioning across different species, which may contribute to, at least in part, to the differential in the systemic MMAE levels observed <i>in vivo</i> between preclinical and clinical studies.

Currently, there are no ways to therapeutically target Wilms tumor driver mutations, such as in the microRNA processing gene DROSHA. Here we used a \"multi-omics\" approach to define the effects of DROSHA mutation in Wilms tumor. We categorized Wilms tumor mutations into four mutational subclasses with unique transcriptional effects: microRNA processing, MYCN activation, chromatin remodeling, and kidney developmental factors. In particular, we find that DROSHA mutations are correlated with de-repressing microRNA target genes that regulate differentiation and proliferation and a self-renewing, mesenchymal state. We model these findings by inhibiting DROSHA expression in a Wilms tumor cell line, which led to upregulation of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D2 (CCND2). Furthermore, we observed that DROSHA mutations in Wilms tumor and DROSHA silencing in vitro were associated with a mesenchymal state with aberrations in redox metabolism. Accordingly, we demonstrate that Wilms tumor cells lacking microRNAs are sensitized to ferroptotic cell death through inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), the enzyme that detoxifies lipid peroxides.

It is well-established that males experience shorter life spans than females, and this sex bias on overall mortality is ac-centuated in populations with longer life expectancy, in part related to elevated rates of cancer. The majority of human malignancies exhibit a sex bias with elevated frequencies in males. For many of these cancer types, the disparity has not been explained by environmental risk factors such as tobacco use.

Current treatments targeting amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau have shown limited effectiveness, necessitating further research on the aggregation and toxicity mechanisms. One of these mechanisms involves the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of tau, contributing to the formation of pathogenic tau aggregates, although their conformational details remain elusive. Another mechanism is ferroptosis, a type of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation-mediated cell death, which has been implicated in AD. There is a lack of therapeutic strategies that simultaneously target amyloid toxicity and ferroptosis. This study aims to explore the potential of polycatechols, PDP and PLDP, consisting of dopamine and L-Dopa, respectively, as multifunctional agents to modulate the pathological nexus between ferroptosis and AD. Polycatechols were found to sequester the labile iron pool (LIP), inhibit A\u03b2 and tau aggregation, scavenge free radicals, protect mitochondria, and prevent ferroptosis, thereby rescuing neuronal cell death. Interestingly, PLDP promotes tau LLPS, and modulates their intermolecular interactions to inhibit the formation of toxic tau aggregates, offering a conceptually innovative approach to tackle tauopathies.

The mitigation of clinical cases requires the understanding of contamination pathways in each food process and the characterization of resident microbiota in the productive environments, so that targeted sanitizing procedures can be effectively implemented. Nowadays these investigations can benefit from the complementary and thoughtful use of culture- and omics-based analyses, although their application <i>in situ</i> is still limited. Therefore, the 16S-rRNA gene-based sequencing of total DNA and the targeted isolation of <i>Arcobacter</i> spp. through enrichment were performed to reconstruct the environmental contamination pathways within a poultry abattoir, as well as the dynamics and distribution of this emerging pathogen. To that scope, broiler's neck skin and caeca have been sampled during processing, while environmental swabs were collected from surfaces after cleaning and sanitizing. Metataxonomic survey highlighted a negligible impact of fecal contamination and a major role of broiler's skin in determining the composition of the resident abattoir microbiota. The introduction of <i>Arcobacter</i> spp. in the environment was mainly conveyed by this source rather than the intestinal content. <i>Arcobacter butzleri</i> represented one of the most abundant species and was extensively detected in the abattoir by both metataxonomic and enrichment methods, showing higher prevalence than other more thermophilic Campylobacterota.

In the present study, we examined whether red ginseng extract (RGE) exerts antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA). RGE had no bactericidal activity, at least in the range of dissolvable concentration. However, RGE reduced 0.03-0.25-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (oxacillin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, and cefazolin) and aminoglycoside antibiotics (kanamycin and gentamicin) against the two laboratory strains of MRSA. Moreover, the fractional inhibitory concentration index indicated the synergistic activity of RGE with each of the antibiotics. RGE also increased the kanamycin sensitivity of 15 MRSA strains isolated from human volunteers and increased the ampicillin sensitivity of five MRSA strains isolated from dairy cows diagnosed with bovine mastitis. In contrast, RGE did not alter the MIC values of fosfomycin, tetracycline, and erythromycin, suggesting that RGE acts selectively. In contrast, Triton X-100, which was reported to reduce the MIC value of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics to MRSA by increasing membrane permeability, reduced the MIC values of fosfomycin and tetracycline.

In this work, by means of DFT calculations, the coordination of Am<sup>III-VI</sup> with five typical N-donor ligands, i.e., terpyridine (tpy), bispyrazinylpyridine (dpp), bistriazinylpyridine (BTP), bistriazinyl bipyridine (BTBP), and bistrazinyl phenanthroline (BTPhen), was studied in terms of energy and topological analysis. The results show that the exchange of aqua ligands of hydrated ions by N-donor ligands is an entropy-driven process and enthalpically unfavorable.

Typically, the configurational isomerization of such switches into two distinct forms (E/Z) occurs through the alteration of the pH the medium, achieved by successive additions of acid and base stimuli. However, this process results in intermittent operation due to the concomitant accumulation of salt after each cycle, limiting switching performance to only a few cycles (5-6). In this context, we introduce a novel strategy for the autonomous E/Z isomerization of hydrazones in acetonitrile using pulses of trichloroacetic acid as a chemical fuel. The use of this transient acid enabled reversible switching of hydrazones even after 50 cycles without causing significant fatigue. To test the broad viability of the fuel, a series of ortho/para-substituted hydrazones were synthesized and their switching performance was investigated. The analysis of kinetic data showed a strong dependency of switching operations including the lifetime of transient state, on the electronic properties of substituents. Finally, a distinct color change from yellow to orange due to reversible switching of the para-methoxy substituted hydrazone was employed for the creation of rewritable messages on commercially available paper.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "04", "day": "22"}}, {"article_title": "Coma in adult cerebral venous thrombosis: The BEAST study.", "article_abstract": "Coma is an independent predictor of poor clinical outcomes in cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT).

The present study, for the first time, comprehensively reviews the studies from 2011 to 2023 on reducing the <i>in vitro</i> toxicity of AmB. The findings showed that loading AmB with micellar structures, nanostructured lipid carriers, liposomes, emulsions, poly lactide-co-glycolide acid, chitosan, dendrimers, and other polymeric nanoparticles increases the biocompatibility and efficacy of the drug and significantly reduces toxicity. In addition, modified carbon nanoparticles (including graphene, carbon nanotubes, and carbon dots) with positively charged amine groups, PEI, and other components showed favorable drug delivery properties. Uncoated and coated magnetic nanoparticles and silver NPs-AmB composites had less cytotoxicity and more antifungal activity than free AmB. Citrate-reduced GNPs and lipoic acid-functionalized GNPs were also effective nanocarriers to reduce AmB cytotoxicity and improve anti-leishmania efficacy. In addition, zinc oxide-NPs and PEGylated zinc oxide-NPs showed favorable antifungal activity and negligible toxicity. According to a review study, carbon-based nanoparticles, metal nanoparticles, and especially polymer nanoparticles caused some reduction in the toxicity and improved solubility of AmB in water.

Furthermore, tailoring treatment with currently available JAK inhibitors (such as ruxolitinib or fedratinib) does not modify the natural history of the disease and has important limitations, including cytopenias. Since recent studies have highlighted the role of miR-146a, a negative regulator of the NF-\u03baB pathway, in the pathogenesis of MF; here we used miR-146a<sup>-/-</sup> (KO) mice, a MF-like model lacking driver mutations, to investigate whether pharmacological inhibition of JAK/STAT and/or NF-\u03baB pathways may reverse the myelofibrotic phenotype of these mice. Specifically, we tested the JAK1/2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib; the NF-\u03baB inhibitor via IKK\u03b1/\u03b2, BMS-345541; both inhibitors in combination; or a dual inhibitor of both pathways (JAK2/IRAK1), pacritinib. Although all treatments decreased spleen size and partially recovered its architecture, only NF-\u03baB inhibition, either using BMS-345541 (alone or in combination) or pacritinib, resulted in a reduction of extramedullary hematopoiesis, bone marrow (BM) fibrosis and osteosclerosis, along with an attenuation of the exacerbated inflammatory state (via IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1).

The in vitro degradation study showed significant loss of mechanical properties compatible with a decrease in molar mass, accompanied by changes in morphology. The histocompatibility association of mesenchymal stem cells from rabbit's bone marrow, and PLDLA-TMC scaffolds, were evaluated in the meniscus regeneration, proving the potential of cell culture at in vivo tissue regeneration. Nine New Zealand rabbits underwent total medial meniscectomy, yielding three treatments: implantation of the seeded PLDLA-TMC scaffold, implantation of the unseeded PLDLA-TMC and negative control (defect without any implant).

E93 homozygous mutant females of T. domestica exhibit severe fecundity deficiency due to impaired previtellogenic development of the ovarian follicles, likely because E93 induces the expression of genes involved in ECM (extracellular matrix)-receptor interactions during previtellogenesis. Moreover, we revealed that in the hemimetabolous cockroach Blattella germanica, E93 similarly promotes previtellogenic ovarian development.

Maximizing anterior sphenoidectomy is important for the median approach, and lateralizing the pterygopalatine fossa is crucial for the paramedian approach. Maximizing the surgical corridor in the nasal cavity and minimizing damage to neurovascular structures are vital for establishing a surgical field with minimal bleeding, ensuring safe, precise, and gentle procedures. However, the relationship between the maxillofacial and skull base bones in endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery is difficult to understand because these bones are intricately articulated, making it challenging to visualize each bone's outline. Understanding important bones and their related neurovascular structures is essential for all skull base surgeons to maximize the surgical corridor and minimize iatrogenic injury to neurovascular structures. This study aimed to elucidate the role of the palatine bone from a microsurgical anatomical perspective. Three dry skulls were used to demonstrate the structure of the palatine bone and its relationship with surrounding bones. A formalin-perfused cadaveric head was dissected to show the related neurovascular structures. The arteries and veins of the cadaveric heads were injected with red- and blue-colored silicon. Dissection was performed using a surgical microscope and endoscope. In addition, the utilization of the palatine bone as a landmark to identify neurovascular structures, which aids in creating a wider surgical field with less bleeding, was shown in two representative cases. The palatine bone consists of unique complex structures, including the sphenoidal process, ethmoidal crest, pterygopalatine canal, and sphenopalatine notch, which are closely related to the sphenopalatine artery, maxillary nerve, and its branches. The ethmoidal crest of the palatine bone is a well-known structure that is useful for identifying the sphenopalatine foramen, controlling the sphenopalatine artery and nerve, and safely opening the pterygopalatine fossa. The sphenoidal process of the palatine bone is a valuable landmark for identifying the palatovaginal artery, which is a landmark used to safely and efficiently expose the vidian canal.

On top of the legal and regulatory complexities surrounding its implementation, the majority of tested machine learning (ML)-based predictive algorithms do not display the exquisite performance needed to render them unequivocal, standalone decision makers for matters with direct implications to human health. We are thus moving into a different model of \"computer-assisted diagnostics\", where AI is there to provide support, rather than replacing, the pathologist. Herein we focus on the practical aspects of CP, from a pathologist perspective. There is a wide range of potential applications where CP can enhance precision of pathology diagnosis, tailor prognostic and predictive information, as well as save time. There are, however, a number of potential limitations for CP that currently hinder their wider adoption in the clinical setting. We address the key necessary steps towards clinical implementation of computational pathology, discuss the significant obstacles that hinders its adoption in the clinical context and summarize some proposed solutions.

This response, called shade avoidance syndrome (SAS), involves photoreceptors such as phytochromes as well as phytochrome interacting factors (PIFs), which regulate the expression of growth-mediating genes. Numerous cell wall-related genes belong to the putative targets of PIFs, and the importance of cell wall modifications for enabling growth was extensively shown in developmental models such as dark-grown hypocotyl. However, the contribution of the cell wall in the growth of de-etiolated seedlings regulated by shade cues remains poorly established. Through analyses of mechanical and biochemical properties of the cell wall coupled with transcriptomic analysis of cell wall-related genes from previously published data, we provide evidence suggesting that cell wall modifications are important for neighbor proximity-induced elongation. Further analysis using loss-of-function mutants impaired in the synthesis and remodeling of the main cell wall polymers corroborated this. We focused on the <i>cgr2cgr3</i> double mutant that is defective in methylesterification of homogalacturonan (HG)-type pectins. By following hypocotyl growth kinetically and spatially and analyzing the mechanical and biochemical properties of cell walls, we found that methylesterification of HG-type pectins was required to enable global cell wall modifications underlying neighbor proximity-induced hypocotyl growth.

Here, we propose the 3-2-1 approach as a schema to be implemented in the proper setting for the surgical management of a PAS cesarean hysterectomy. The 3-2-1 approach begins with the surgical dissection of three anatomical landmarks that ultimately facilitate a safe surgical site for the ligation and transection of the uterine vessels. First-step is identification of the three anatomical landmarks which are <i>(i)</i> posterior lower uterine segment peritoneum de-serosalization, <i>(ii)</i> identification of the ureters laterally, and <i>(iii)</i> anterior bladder dissection. Posterior-to-anterior progression avoids encountering dense adhesions and hypervascularity in the anterior lower uterine segment early in the surgery. Further, allows better mobilization of the uterus to identify the anatomical landmarks laterally and anteriorly. Second-step is to deploy the 2-hand technique where the surgeon places one hand anteriorly and the other hand posteriorly in the lower uterine segment below the placental bed. The surgeon brings both hands together with flexed fingers perpendicular to the uterine tissue and gently elevates the uterus and placenta out of the pelvis and ensures safe anatomical distance to surrounding structures. Third-step is the consideration of a supracervical hysterectomy.

As such, they are valuable tools to investigate the effects of climate change on forest ecosystems. Specifically, they allow testing of hypotheses regarding long-term ecosystem dynamics and provide means to assess the impacts of climate scenarios on future forest development. As a consequence, numerous local-scale simulation studies have been conducted over the past decades to assess the impacts of climate change on forests. These studies apply the best available models tailored to local conditions, parameterized and evaluated by local experts. However, this treasure trove of knowledge on climate change responses remains underexplored to date, as a consistent and harmonized dataset of local model simulations is missing. Here, our objectives were (i) to compile existing local simulations on forest development under climate change in Europe in a common database, (ii) to harmonize them to a common suite of output variables, and (iii) to provide a standardized vector of auxiliary environmental variables for each simulated location to aid subsequent investigations. Our dataset of European stand- and landscape-level forest simulations contains over 1.1 million simulation runs representing 135 million simulation years for more than 13,000 unique locations spread across Europe. The data were harmonized to consistently describe forest development in terms of stand structure (dominant height), composition (dominant species, admixed species), and functioning (leaf area index). Auxiliary variables provided include consistent daily climate information (temperature, precipitation, radiation, vapor pressure deficit) as well as information on local site conditions (soil depth, soil physical properties, soil water holding capacity, plant-available nitrogen).

Inhaled NO has the unique ability to exert its vasodilatory effects in the pulmonary vasculature without any hypotensive side-effects in the systemic circulation. In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, NO has been reported in numerous studies to exert beneficial effects on acutely lowering pulmonary artery pressure and reversing right ventricular dysfunction and/or failure. Yet, various investigations failed to demonstrate significant differences in long-term clinical outcomes. The authors, serving as an advisory board of international experts in the field of inhaled NO within pediatric and adult cardiac surgery, will discuss how the existing scientific evidence can be further improved. We will summarize the basic mechanisms underlying the clinical applications of inhaled NO and how this translates into the mandate for inhaled NO in cardiac surgery. We will move on to the popular use of inhaled NO and will talk about the evidence base of the use of this selective pulmonary vasodilator. This review will elucidate what kind of clinical and biological barriers and gaps in knowledge need to be solved and how this has impacted in the development of clinical trials. The authors will elaborate on how the optimization of inhaled NO therapy, the development of biomarkers to identify the target population and the definition of response can improve the design of future large clinical trials.

However, existing technologies have not achieved the desired clinical success due to several limitations. To overcome practical and cost-associated obstacles of existing ACS methods, we have established a novel methodology for rapid, enzymatic disaggregation of human skin cells and their isolation using a procedure that requires no specialist laboratory instrumentation and is performed at room temperature. <b>Methods:</b> Cells were isolated using enzymatic disaggregation of split-thickness human skin followed by several filtration steps for isolation of cell populations, and cell viability was determined. Individual population recovery was confirmed in appropriate culture medium types, and the presence of epidermal stem cells (EpSCs) within keratinocyte sub-populations was defined by flow cytometry via detection of CD49 and CD71. Positive mediators of wound healing secreted by ACS-derived cultures established on a collagen-based wound-bed mimic were detected by proteome arrays and quantified by ELISA, and the role of such mediators was determined by cell proliferation assays. The effect of ACS-derived conditioned-medium on myofibroblasts was investigated using an <i>in-vitro</i> model of myofibroblast differentiation via detection of \u03b1-SMA using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. <b>Results:</b> Our methodology permitted efficient recovery of keratinocytes, fibroblasts and melanocytes, which remained viable upon long-term culture. ACS-derivatives comprised sub-populations with the CD49-high/CD71-low expression profile known to demarcate EpSCs. Via secretion of mitogenic factors and wound healing-enhancing mediators, the ACS secretome accelerated keratinocyte proliferation and markedly curtailed cytodifferentiation of myofibroblasts, the latter being key mediators of fibrosis and scarring. <b>Discussion:</b> The systematic characterisation of the cell types within our ACS isolates provided evidence for their superior cell viability and the presence of EpSCs that are critical drivers of wound healing. We defined the biological properties of ACS-derived keratinocytes, which include ability to secrete positive mediators of wound healing as well as suppression of myofibroblast cytodifferentiation. Thus, our study provides several lines of evidence that the established ACS isolates comprise highly-viable cell populations which can physically support wound healing and possess biological properties that have the potential to enhance not only the speed but also the quality of wound healing.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "04", "day": "05"}}, {"article_title": "Inhibition of gut digestive proteases by cyanobacterial diets decreases infection in a <i>Daphnia</i> host-parasite system.", "article_abstract": "Secondary metabolites produced by primary producers have a wide range of functions as well as indirect effects outside the scope of their direct target. Research suggests that protease inhibitors produced by cyanobacteria influence grazing by herbivores and may also protect against parasites of cyanobacteria. In this study, we asked whether those same protease inhibitors produced by cyanobacteria could also influence the interactions of herbivores with their parasites. We used the <i>Daphnia</i>-<i>Metschnikowia</i> zooplankton host-fungal parasite system to address this question because it is well documented that cyanobacteria protease inhibitors suppress trypsin and chymotrypsin in the gut of <i>Daphnia</i>, and because it is known that <i>Metschnikowia</i> infects via the gut. We tested the hypothesis that <i>Daphnia</i> gut proteases are necessary for <i>Metschnikowia</i> spores to be released from their asci. We then also tested whether diets that decrease trypsin and chymotrypsin activity in the guts of <i>Daphnia</i> lead to lower levels of infection. Our results show that chymotrypsin promotes the release of the fungal spores from their asci. Moreover, a diet that strongly inhibited chymotrypsin activity in <i>Daphnia</i> decreased infection levels, particularly in the most susceptible <i>Daphnia</i> clones. Our results support the growing literature that cyanobacterial diets can be beneficial to zooplankton hosts when challenged by parasites and uncover a mechanism that contributes to the protective effect of cyanobacterial diets. Specifically, we demonstrate that host chymotrypsin enzymes promote the dehiscence of <i>Metschnikowia</i> spores; when cyanobacteria inhibit the activity of chymotrypsin in hosts, this most likely traps the spore inside the ascus, preventing the parasite from puncturing the gut and beginning the infection process.

However, synapses can be classified into two primary morphological types: Gray's type I and type II, corresponding to Colonnier's asymmetric (AS) and symmetric (SS) synapses, respectively. AS and SS have a thick and thin postsynaptic density, respectively. In the cerebral cortex, since most AS are excitatory (glutamatergic), and SS are inhibitory (GABAergic), determining the distribution, size, density, and proportion of the two major cortical types of synapses is critical, not only to better understand synaptic organization in terms of connectivity, but also from a functional perspective. However, several technical challenges complicate the study of synapses. Potassium ferrocyanide has been utilized in recent volume electron microscope studies to enhance electron density in cellular membranes. However, identifying synaptic junctions, especially SS, becomes more challenging as the postsynaptic densities become thinner with increasing concentrations of potassium ferrocyanide. Here we describe a protocol employing Focused Ion Beam Milling and Scanning Electron Microscopy for studying brain tissue. The focus is on the unequivocal identification of AS and SS types. To validate SS observed using this protocol as GABAergic, experiments with immunocytochemistry for the vesicular GABA transporter were conducted on fixed mouse brain tissue sections.

In this study, we investigated the social contagion/buffering phenomena in behavior and neuroendocrine mechanisms after exposure to chronic stress, in groups of rats living in the PhenoWorld (PhW). Three groups were tested (8 stressed rats, 8 unstressed rats, and a mixed group with 4 and 4) and these were analyzed under 4 conditions: stressed (pure stress group, n\u00a0=\u00a08), unstressed (naive control group, n\u00a0=\u00a08), stressed from mixed group (stressed companion group, n\u00a0=\u00a08), unstressed from mixed group (unstressed companion group, n\u00a0=\u00a08. While naive control animals remained undisturbed, pure stress group animals were all exposed to stress. Half of the animals under the mixed-treatment condition were exposed to stress (stressed companion group) and cohabitated with their unstressed partners (unstressed companion group). We confirmed the well-established chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) effects in physiological, behavioral, and neuroendocrine endpoints; body weight gain, open arm entries and time in EPM, and oxytocin receptor expression levels in the amygdala decreased by stress exposure, whereas adrenal weight was increased by stress. Furthermore, we found that playing, rearing and solitary resting behaviors decreased, whereas huddling behavior increased by CUS. In addition, we detected significant increases (stress-buffering) in body weight gain and huddling behaviors between pure stress and stress companion animals, and significant stress contagion effects in emotional behavior and oxytocin receptor expression levels between naive control and control companion groups. Hence, we demonstrate buffering and contagion effects were evident in physiological parameters, emotional behaviors, and social home-cage behaviors of rats and we suggest a possible mediation of these effects by oxytocin neurotransmission.

This study aimed to determine the quality and chemical composition of <i>Pimpinella candolleana</i> and to identify its potential therapeutic targets and mechanisms in acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) rats through integrated approaches. <b>Methods:</b> Morphological and microscopic characteristics, thin layer chromatography (TLC) identification, and quantitative analysis of <i>P. candolleana</i> were performed. UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, network pharmacology, and molecular docking were used to identify its chemical composition and predict its related targets in UC. Furthermore, a rat model was established to evaluate the therapeutic effect and potential mechanism of <i>P. candolleana</i> on UC. <b>Results:</b> Microscopic identification revealed irregular and radial arrangement of the xylem in <i>P. candolleana</i>, with a light green cross-section and large medullary cells.

Hence, lithium-sulfur batteries have greater safety risks than lithium-ion batteries.

However, it remains unclear whether SUMOylation regulates enhancer marks, acetylation at the 27th lysine residue of the histone H3 protein (H3K27Ac). To investigate whether SUMOylation regulates H3K27Ac, we performed genome-wide ChIP-seq analyses and discovered that knockdown (KD) of the SUMO activating enzyme catalytic subunit UBA2 reduced H3K27Ac at most enhancers. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that TFAP2C-binding sites are enriched in enhancers whose H3K27Ac was reduced by UBA2 KD.

However, this is not due to the SUMOylation of TFAP2C itself. Proteomics analysis of TFAP2C interactome on the chromatin identified histone deacetylation (HDAC) and RNA splicing machineries that contain many SUMOylation targets.

Using an Ezh2 gain-of-function mutation, <i>Ezh2 <sup>Y641F</sup></i> , we found that Treg cells expressing <i>Ezh2 <sup>Y641F</sup></i> displayed an increased effector Treg phenotype and were poised for improved homing to organ tissues. Expression of <i>Ezh2 <sup>Y641F</sup></i> in Treg cells led to more rapid remission from autoimmunity.

We investigated this using neuroimaging and genetic data from adults (UK Biobank, N = 31,748) and children (ABCD, N = 4,928). Using polygenic scores and genetic correlations we observe a robust negative association between common variants for autism and a magnetic resonance imaging derived phenotype for neurite density (intracellular volume fraction) in the general population. This result is consistent across both children and adults, in both the cortex and in white matter tracts, and confirmed using polygenic scores and genetic correlations.

We investigated how mitochondrial metabolism influences SCN cancer (SCNC) progression. Extensive bioinformatics analyses encompassing thousands of patient tumors and human cancer cell lines uncovered enhanced expression of PGC-1\u03b1, a potent regulator of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), across several SCNC types. PGC-1\u03b1 correlated tightly with increased expression of the lineage marker ASCL1 through a positive feedback mechanism. Analyses using a human prostate tissue-based SCN transformation system showed that the ASCL1 subtype has heightened PGC-1\u03b1 expression and OXPHOS activity. PGC-1\u03b1 inhibition diminished OXPHOS, reduced SCNC cell proliferation, and blocked SCN prostate tumor formation. PGC-1\u03b1 overexpression enhanced OXPHOS, tripled the SCN prostate tumor formation rate, and promoted commitment to the ASCL1 lineage.

Here, we induced systemic inflammation through repeated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections either in the morning (ZT1) or evening (ZT13) under standard lighting conditions, then examined BBB permeability to a polar molecule, sodium fluorescein. We observed clear diurnal variation in inflammatory BBB permeability, with a striking increase in paracellular leak across the BBB specifically following evening LPS injection. Evening LPS led to persisting glia activation and inflammation in the brain that was not observed in the periphery. The exaggerated evening neuroinflammation and BBB disruption were suppressed by microglial depletion or through keeping mice in constant darkness.

However, typical DE analysis includes selection of genes based on a threshold of fold change in expression under the implicit assumption that all genes are equally sensitive to dosage changes of their transcripts. This tends to favor highly variable genes over more constrained genes where even small changes in expression may be biologically relevant. To address this limitation, we have developed a method to recalibrate each gene's differential expression fold change based on genetic expression variance observed in the human population. The newly established metric ranks statistically differentially expressed genes not by nominal change of expression, but by relative change in comparison to natural dosage variation for each gene. We apply our method to RNA sequencing datasets from rare disease and in-vitro stimulus response experiments. Compared to the standard approach, our method adjusts the bias in discovery towards highly variable genes, and enriches for pathways and biological processes related to metabolic and regulatory activity, indicating a prioritization of functionally relevant driver genes. With that, our method provides a novel view on DE and contributes towards bridging the existing gap between statistical and biological significance.

We hypothesized that bvFTD-tau and bvFTD-TDP have distinct laminar distributions of pyramidal neurodegeneration along cortical gradients, a topologic order of cytoarchitectonic subregions based on increasing pyramidal density and laminar differentiation.

Our data suggest loss of neurofilament-rich pyramidal neurons is a clinically relevant feature of bvFTD that selectively worsens along a frontal cortical gradient in bvFTD-tau, not bvFTD-TDP.

This switch from solitary to gregarious populations is highly dependent on favorable weather conditions. Climate change, which has been hypothesized to shift conditions towards increasing risks of gregarization, is therefore likely to have significant impacts on the spatial distribution and likelihood of outbreak events. However, the desert locust is intensely managed at large scales, which possibly counteracts any increased risk of outbreaks due to a more favorable climate. Consequently, understanding the changes in risks in the future involves teasing out the effects of climate change and management actions. Here we studied the dynamics of gregarization at the very early stages of potential outbreaks, in parallel with trends in climate and management, between 1985 and 2018 in western Africa. We used three different spatial scales, with the goal to have a better understanding of the potential effects of climate change per se while controlling for management. Our first approach was to look at a regional scale, where we observed an overall decrease in gregarization events. However, this scale includes very heterogeneous environments and management efforts. To consider this heterogeneity, we divided the area into a grid of 0.5\u00b0 cells. For each cell, a climate analysis was performed for rainfall and temperature, with trends obtained by a harmonic decomposition model on monthly data. Analyses of gregarization showed only a few significant trends, both positive and negative, mainly found in western Mauritania where management effort has increased. To improve the statistical power, these cells were then grouped into larger homogeneous climatic clusters, i.e. groups of cells with similar climatic conditions and similar climatic trends over the study period. At this scale, gregarization events depend on the intersection between climate conditions and management efforts. The clusters where gregarization increased were also the ones with the highest increase of management. These results highlight the important effect of preventive management, which may counteract the positive effects of climate change on locust proliferation.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "04", "day": "04"}}, {"article_title": "Multi-domain wavelet boundary element method for calculating two-dimensional stress intensity factors.", "article_abstract": "In order to improve the accuracy of stress intensity factors (SIFs) calculated by traditional boundary element methods (BEM), the multi-domain wavelet boundary element method (WBEM) is proposed. Firstly, by adjusting the nodes of the B-spline wavelet element on the interval, crack-tip elements are constructed. Since B-spline wavelet on the interval (BSWI) has excellent compact support characteristics and is particularly suitable for describing solution domains with large gradient changes, the constructed crack-tip can reduce the numerical oscillation effect near the crack tip. Secondly, the crack-tip elements are implemented into WBEM. And the combination of WBEM and multi-domain technology can effectively handle interface cracks. Thirdly, the crack problem solving strategy based on multi-domain WBEM can directly evaluate the SIFs of cracks.

To investigate the validity, the model was compared to simultaneous data collection from markers on a scapular intracortical pin. The interrater reliability was tested by comparing the skin marker-based protocol performed by two investigators. The mean root mean square error (RMSE) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC(2,1)) were calculated to determine the validity and the interrater reliability, respectively.

The interviews were audio recorded with the permission of the participants, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the method of conventional content analysis. For this study, 17 mothers were interviewed. Of those, 7 had one school-age child, 8 had two, and 2 had three. All of the children lived with both their mother and father. The majority of the mothers (16 out of 17) held bachelor's degrees. On average, the students were 11.76 years old. Fourteen of the students attended public schools, while 3 attended private schools. Most of the mothers (14 out of 17) reported their financial status as average. Data analysis led to the identification of 3 main themes and 12 subthemes.

The design of the car, particularly the rear end shape and the rear wing's presence, affect base pressure and the diffuser's performance. Previous studies have investigated the effects of diffuser geometry on aerodynamic performance, but the current study is the first to examine the relationship between the diffuser and the rear tires. It also provides specific and quantitative results on the impact of different diffuser design parameters on drag and downforce. The relationship between the rear tires and the double-element inverted wing diffuser using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was investigated. This is an essential problem because the diffuser is a critical component of sports cars, and its design can significantly impact aerodynamic performance. CFD was used to simulate the flow of air around the car model. The CFD model was based on the Nissan Sunny (Versa) type Almera design, and the diffuser main element and flap wing angles were set at 4 and 15.5\u00b0, respectively. The flap gap, overlap distance, and wing ride height above the ground were varied to achieve an optimal aerodynamic design. The study found that the wing's ride height significantly influences the flow through the diffuser. The diffuser significantly impacts base pressure and downforce production. Increasing the ride height decreases base pressure, leading to an increase in downforce until a specific point near the car body, where downforce further increases. The study concluded that the best double-element diffuser design was selected based on lift-to-drag results and the allowable dimensions of the car, wing ride height, element gap, and overlap distances. Ultimately, the best diffuser wing design features a ride height of 154\u00a0mm, a gap distance of 10\u00a0mm, and an overlap of 5\u00a0mm.

The probe rapidly (100 s) detects and quantifies the nerve-agent simulant diethyl chlorophosphate (DCP) in both solution and vapor phases.

In total, 428 pregnant women were studied; most of them were aged between 20 and 25 years and were white. Pregnant women who presented high consumption of UPF were 1.42-fold (95%CI 1.06;1.92) more likely to experience anxiety and presented a prevalence 56% (95%CI 1.18;2.07) higher of stress when compared to those who did not present high consumption of UPF. The prevalence of depressive symptoms and feelings of sadness was 1.31-fold (95%CI 1.08;1.60) and 3.41-fold (95%CI 1.77;6.58) higher among those with high consumption of UPF, respectively.

However, the functions of RHL subfamily members in moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) remain unknown. In this study, we identified 14 bHLH genes (PeRHL1-PeRHL14) in moso bamboo. Phylogenetic tree and conserved motif analyses showed that PeRHLs were clustered into three clades. The expression analysis suggested that PeRHL4 was co-expressed with PeTIP1-1 and PePHT1-1 in moso bamboo. Moreover, these three genes were all up-regulated in moso bamboo under drought stress and phosphate starvation. Y1H, DLR\u00a0and EMSA assays demonstrated that PeRHL4 could activate the expression of PeTIP1-1 and PePHT1-1. Furthermore, overexpression of PeRHL4 could increase both drought and phosphate starvation tolerance in transgenic rice, in which the expression of OsTIPs and OsPHT1s was significantly improved, respectively. Overall, our results indicated that drought stress and phosphate starvation could induce the expression of PeRHL4, which in turn activated downstream genes involved in water and phosphate transport.

Whether the formation of secondary growth in the stem base results in differences in embolism resistance between the base and the upper portions of stems is unknown. We assessed the embolism resistance of leaves and the basal and upper portions of stems simultaneously within the same individuals of two divergent herbaceous species that undergo secondary growth in the mature stem bases. The species were Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) and Senecio minimus (fireweed). Basal stem in mature plants of both species displayed advanced secondary growth and greater resistance to embolism than the upper stem. This also resulted in significant vulnerability segmentation between the basal stem and the leaves in both species. Greater embolism resistance in the woodier stem base was found alongside decreases in the pith-to-xylem ratio, increases in the proportion of secondary xylem, and increases in lignin content. We show that there can be considerable variation in embolism resistance across the stem in herbs and that this variation is linked to the degree of secondary growth present. A gradient in embolism resistance across the stem in herbaceous plants could be an adaptation to ensure reproduction or basal resprouting during episodes of drought late in the lifecycle.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "04", "day": "21"}}, {"article_title": "A pilot-scale assessment of five common weeds in the sustainable treatment of sewage utilizing SHEFROL<sup>\u00ae</sup>, with prospects of a closed-loop biorefinery.", "article_abstract": "Relative efficacy of five common weeds-of the kind that are either rooted in soil or which freely float over water-was assessed in rapid, effective and sustainable treatment of sewage at pilot plant scale in the recently developed and patented SHEFROL<sup>\u00ae</sup> bioreactors. The plants were utilized in a unit of capacity 12,000 liters/day (LPD) which, after two years of use, was enlarged to handle 40,000 LPD of sewage. It was then further expanded after an year to treat 57,000 LPD. All the five weeds, of which none has previously been tested in a pilot-scale SHEFROL, were able to foster highly efficient primary treatment (in terms of suspended and total solids) and secondary treatment (in terms of BOD and COD) to levels exceeding 85% in most cases. Additionally, the weeds also helped in achieving significant tertiary treatment. At different hydraulic retention times, and at steady state, the five weeds achieved treatment of BOD, COD, suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorous, copper, nickel, zinc, and manganese in the ranges, 80-95, 79-91, 82-95, 61-71, 51-73, 37-43, 30-38, 39-47, and 27-35%, respectively. It all occurred in a single process step and without the use of any machine or chemical. This made the system not only simple and inexpensive to install but also to maintain. Over continuous long-term operation for four years, the system was seen to be very robust as it was able to handle wide variations in the volumes and characteristics of sewage, as well as absorb shock loads without compromising the reactor performance. The sustainability of the system can be further enhanced by upgrading it to a circular biorefinery. Energy sources in the form of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) can be extracted from the weeds removed from SHEFROL and then the weeds can be converted into organic fertilizer using high-rate vermireactors recently developed by the authors.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "04", "day": "21"}}, {"article_title": "Pyogenic liver abscesses in peritoneal dialysis patients: A single-centre retrospective case series.", "article_abstract": "Peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related infection rates have improved, but serious complications such as liver abscesses remain an issue, posing unique management challenges including safety of continuing PD versus early PD catheter removal.

A total of 11/383 PD patients (2.9%) were treated for liver abscesses. Most were diabetic (<i>n</i> =10, 90.9%), with a median PD vintage of 541 days (interquartile range: 310-931 days). Fever (<i>n</i> = 7, 63.6%), bacteraemia (<i>n</i> = 7, 63.6%) and concomitant PD peritonitis (<i>n</i> = 7, 63.6%) were the most common presenting symptoms.

The nanostructure was prepared by coating the COF layer on AuNPs and then in situ synthesizing PdNPs within the COF shell. With the respective SERS activity and catalytic performance of the AuNP core and COF-PdNPs shell, the nanostructure can be directly used in the SERS study of the catalytic reaction processes. It was shown that the confinement effect of COF resulted in the high dispersity of PdNPs and outstanding catalytic activity of AuNPs@COF-PdNPs, thus improving the reaction rate constant of the AuNPs@COF-PdNPs-catalyzed hydrogenation reduction by 10 times higher than that obtained with Au/Pd NPs. In addition, the COF layer can serve as a protective shell to make AuNPs@COF-PdNPs possess excellent reusability. Moreover, the loading of PdNPs within the COF layer was found to be in favor of avoiding intermediate products to achieve a high total conversion rate. AuNPs@COF-PdNPs also showed great catalytic activities toward the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction.

We propose a CPlex test system, including one hexa- and 12 tetranucleotide autosomal STR loci, as well as two sex loci, that is equally efficient in DNA identification of biological samples of the wolf and the dog. Analysis of molecular variance between samples revealed significant differentiation values (F<sub>ST</sub>\u2009=\u20090.0784, p\u2009<\u20090.001), which allows to use the panel to differentiate wolf and dog samples. Population subdivision coefficients (\u03b8-values) were calculated for each of the 13 STR loci of the developed test system. It was shown that the values of the genotype frequency for dogs and wolves, without and with considering the \u03b8-value, differ by three orders of magnitude (for dogs 8.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-16</sup> and 2.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-14</sup> and for wolves 1.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-15</sup> and 4.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-14</sup>, respectively). The use of population subdivision coefficients will allow to identify the most reliable results of an expert identification study and the power of exclusion provided by the STR loci of the CPlex test system makes it possible to achieve a reliable level of evidence in forensic DNA analysis of both wolves and dogs.
